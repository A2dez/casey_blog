![*The young priest spoke in 1919 to the Gaelic Society of New York about "The Irish Brigade". In other words, he spoke to The Fenians about The IRA.*](images/clipboard-3119683237.png){alt="The young priest spoke in 1919 to the Gaelic Society of New York about \"The Irish Brigade\"" fig-align="center" width="602"}

We saw in the last post that The Very Reverand Monsignor Richard J Casey amassed a sizeable collection of slides from talks he gave during his time in New York (1915-20) and then afterwards in Ireland during the early years of The Fres State. This time I want to talk about the Revolutionary nature of these talks. Their subject matter, the venues and the newspaper reports, mostly based on newspaper clippings that Casey kept, but also based on more general research into the topic of funding drives in America.

**It is not clear how many talks Casey gave but we have newspaper clippings of several lectures between 1917 and 1919. I can't yet work out exactly when the talks became heavily politicised, but in 1916 there were reports of him giving 'Lenten Sermons' about the religiosity of Irish faithful back home**

It is not clear exactly when Casey began giving presentations with slides, but there is one clipping from 1916 which reports him giving 'Lenten Sermons' about the religiosity of Irish faithful back home. By 1917, he is talking about life in Beautiful Ireland, as we know from his slides. But his talk has also been politicised a lot, and *The Gaelic American* reports that "

```         
"[Casey] took occasion at every appropriate time, to demonstrate alleged pernicious results of English misrule in the country."
```

Clearly, the audience were on the same page as the reports that:

```         
The photographs of Easter Week, 1916, were wildly applauded. 
```

One such name was The Gaelic Society, and by January 1919, Casey was presenting at one of their céilidhthe, a combination that shows how revolutionary fervour could be drummed up amidst a cultural event, and a reminder that the Irish cultural revolution really holds primacy over the political revolution.

### Crowdfunding the Republic

Among the revolutionary fervour, there are slides of Wolfe Tone who led the failed rebellion of 1798, Parnell's body lying in state, and the bronze statue of [Fr William Casey](https://www.dib.ie/biography/casey-william-a1544) in Abbeyfeale, Co. Limerick. This Casey – who is no relation to our subject – must have been quite the role model for our Richard. He was a Gaelgeoir, musician, GAA man, and temperance activist, which I suspect Fr Richard was too. Fr William was most active in the Land League, for which he gained huge local support, and so was Fr Richard's uncle – another Fr Richard J Casey – to whom I shall one day return. There are no slides related to the Fenian Uprising of 1867, even though its veteran John Devoy had become the leading Republican in New York by the time of Casey's lectures. This may be because the Fenians tried to keep a low profile and used codenames for their gatherings.

![asdlfkj](images/central_opera_new_york.jpg)

Casey's lecture to The Gaelic Society was about 'The Irish Brigade", a term used to refer to each sub-unit of the Irish Republican Army, and in May 1919 he was performing at The Central Opera House for between 1200 and 1800 listeners. This venue was used for 'ethnic theatre' and it occasionally showed [films about Ireland.](https://nyirishhistory.us/article/ethnic-cinema-in-nickelodeon-era-new-york-city/)

It's important to note here that these events were not dull lectures, but an 'illustration' of Ireland 'in picture, song and story'. Clearly, Casey was an experienced orator from his sermons, but he was a keen musician and collaborated above with Professor Patrick J McNamara who (need to confirm) ran the St Boniface Holy Name Society. The photo above shows their band – taken from a lantern slide – and, a couple of years after Casey returned home, McNamara wrote to him to lament that there were no more pupils entering the Feis Ceoil. In Casey's time, his pupils won gold and silver medals. Clearly the band were an ideal segue between the talk and the céilidhe.

The music would have had the other function of rousing the audience's political sentiments and encouraging them to donate. In the same month as Casey's talk in the Central Opera House, there were reports of \$19,000 being raised in New York for the Irish cause. No doubt that increased over time as about a quarter of a million would be raised in America for the First Dail Loan. Casey himself contributed to this which we know because his scrapbook contains receipts of the bonds he himself bought. But his role was not as a financial contributor, but as a trusted man of influence who could rouse others to donate their cash.

It was this skill that would prove influential years later when it was time for his younger brother Austie to raise money for the factory in Dungarvan.
