The minister has come here to officially open our factory, and his Lordship the Bishop of Waterford has come to impart God's blessing upon our industry. On your behalf and on that of the people of Dungarvan, I wish to thank those distinguished gentlemen"

            2.  "Hear, hear"

            3.  "The establishment in Dungarvan of the important factory is due mainly to the efforts made by the members of the Dungarvan Industrial Devopment Association, working unselfishly in the interests of their native town and of the townspeople. In referreint to the DIDC, I wish to make special reference to the work of the Chairman, Rev T B Walsh and to the members of the committee, including Dr Michael Casey and PJ Molony. These gentlemen and other members of the committee, to my knowlege, spent many weary months in an effort to secure for the town a suitable industry that would provide much neeede employment. I think everyboyd will agree that their efforts have been successful.

            4.  \[Speaking from a life of experience, he wrote\] The industry is a highly technical one, there is a very large market available within the Irish Free State for its products, and employment is given to over 100 male workers to whom good wages are paid.

                1.  \[include the wage bill here – maybe £300 per week, to be converted to modern money for comparison, but ideally with a list of what that could buy

            5.  I should like to express appreciation to those who invested the necessary capital to permit this industry to be started, said Mr O'Brein. I can assue them that it is now firmly establised, that the company's prospects are, in my opinion, most favourable, and that their interestes will be looked after, to the best of our ability, by me and my co-directors.

            6.  A tribute must be paid to the employees. The managing director has told me that they have adapted themselves very quickly to the training facilities offered to them, and have worked willingly and loyally in the interests of the company.

            7.  The establishment of this industry has been brought about as a result of the industrial policy of the Government, which has as its object the making of this country self-sufficient, and by the creation of industries for the manufacture of the rquirements of the country, giving much-needed employment. From what I have already told you, I think you will agree that this object has been achieved so far as the factory in Dungarvan is concerned.

            8.  As an example of what has been achieved in the leather industry, said Mr O'Brien, I am askign th Minister to accept a pair of slippers. The upper leather of these slippers has been manufactured from native Irish sheepskin tanned in our factory here in Dungaravan; the sole and insold leather from native cow-hide tanned in the neighbouring factory in Portlaw; the lasts on which they have been manufactured were made in the recently established factory in Newbridge \[lasts are a wooden form on which the leather upper of a shoe is shaped.\], and the manufacture of the slippers themselvers was carried out by the well-known and old-establihsed firm of boot and show manufacturers of Messrs Hearne and Cahill, Waterford. The slippers are presented not for their intrinsic valude as a memento of the work done in the establishment and development of Irish industries by the Minister for Industry and commerce.

            9.  Applause

            10. **Just another day at the office for Lemass\
                This is where the cartoon ought to go**

                Replying to the toast, Mr Lemass said thay they had gathered from the newspaper reports that he frequeently had occasion to attend functions like that, and for one holding the position fo Minister for Industry and Commerce it was always a pleasure to be present at such function, but the pleasure was not entirely an unmixed one, because as time passed it became increasingly difficult to say something original. This was the first occasion he was abhle to
