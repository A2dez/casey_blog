The opening of Dickens Leather Factory, on Monday, 3 September, 1937 was a special day in the town's history and it gives us the ideal opportunity to get introduced to the characters in the story and to understand who was who when the factory opened. Officially opened, that is, because the factory was already up and running for fully twelve months (GET DATES) **and, given the circumstances, that was the hard part done, as we shall see.**

The ceremony began with the arrival of Minister Sean Lemass, who was yet again made Minister of Industry and Commerce in the new Dáil of July 1937, where Fianna Fail rubberstamped their authority on the The Irish Free State, winning exactly 50% of seats, before reconstituting the state by the end of the year. Lemass had been most successful in his first ministerial term, opening up countless new factories around the state, including County Waterford's other leather factory in the village of Portlaw.

Lemass alighted in Abbeyside, the village across the bridge from Dungarvan Town, and he we was met by a local priest and most of the directors of Dickens Leather. Fr **T.B.** Walsh was the Chairman of the Dungarvan Industrial Development Association, a group that included two local, Dr Michael Augustine Casey and **Patrick J.** Molony, the managing director of A. Molony and Sons (**shipping?)**This team had agitated hard to get the factory into Dungarvan and the factory in Portlaw proved to be a complementary stepping stone, in terms of both personnel and output. Portlaw's produce was mostly based on hard cowhide leather, used in the soles of the shoes, whereas Dungarvan's produce was mostly based on softer sheepskin leather, used for upper parts of the shoe and inner linings. Their leadership groups were also hugely overlapping. The Chairman of Dickens Leather was Mr Kennedy O'Brien who was becoming something leather baron across Ireland. He was **CHAIR**? of Portlaw, and his core business was as leather merchant in Dublin City. And the Managing Director was the eponymous Reginald Dickens from England, and his family's core business was in Northampton, the most famous city in the world for leather and shoe production. Dungarvan and Portlaw, for him, were side ventures from his main business, run by Reginald and his brothers, and by their father before them since 1897.

The town was ready for its big day and once the men of influence had assembled, the triumphal procession could begin to slither through the freshly decorated streets, to the roars of the crowd, as cheer after cheer rent the air. Varicoloured bunting festooned the main streets and large banners welcomed the Minister to the town. The local Gardaí formed a bodyguard for Lemass and the parade was fronted by the Waterford Brass and Reed band playing familiar airs, many with a nationalistic bent, for the day was an expression of both national and local pride. The crowd filed in behind them like mass-goers forming a queue for communion and, on arrival at Quay Street, they were met by the hundred-plus men who worked in the factory nearby, at The Lookout, looking out at the wide expanse of Dungarvan Bay.

A temporary stand was erected and Lemass was greeted by Kennedy O'Brien in his capacity of Chairman of Dickens Leather. Meanwhile, the band played the National Anthem while the deep crowds looked on. Several welcoming addresses were made. First up were The Urban District Council and then Father Walsh himself. Not one, but two local Fianna Fail groups gave an address: the Padraig Pearse Cumann and the Cathal Brugha Cumannn and, finally, an unidentified of the factory's workforce said some words, with no name given by any of the newspaper reports.

The last public address was made by Lemass himself. He thanked and congratulated the above-mentioned men of power, the workers and his Fianna Fail colleagues in the Cumainn, but also spoke the crowd themselves, noting the importance of the factory in generating employment and prosperity to the locality.

Afterwards, O'Brien presented Lemass with a symbolic gold key to the factory, and, with the church and local government and the politicians having all had their say, and with the band playing Faith of Fathers, it was time for the factory to be blessed solemnly by His Lordship, The Most Reverand Doctor Jeremiah Kinane, Bishop of Waterford and Lismore, ably assisted by the Parish Priest, The Very Reverand T. Canon O'Brien, and his curate, the above-mentioned Reverand TB Walsh.

Afterwards, Dickens gave the Bishop and Minister a guided tour of inspection of the factory

The factory was left open for the local hoards to investigate and one wonders how well supervised the machines were with children running round.

Later in the day, Lemass would point out how great it was that the factory was a truly local venture – and it certainly was for the staff employed in the factory. But the reality is that the directors were a mix of locals (Austie Casey and Joe Molony) with bigger fish.

In July 1937, Fianna Fail had yet again won the general election, and were continuing their policy of applying huge tariffs on imported goods, a policy which facilitated the growth of an unprecendented number of mid-sized factories around the state. Sean Lemass was again the Minister of Industry and Commerce, a position he would hold between 1932 and 1959 for for sixteen intermittent years.
