<p><em>The opening scene of the godfather pulls together the whole community while act 2 starts looking at his actions and interactions. (No spoilers please - it’s been a decade or two since I last watched it)</em></p>
<p><em>The equivalent scene in Dungarvan is the Opening Ceremony of the factory in 1937. All the characters are there. The Caseys. Dickens. Kennedy O’Brien. The government, most notably Lemass. I hope Monsignor Richard was there - he was certainly present at early board meetings. In the cortege behind are the workers and the wider town community. It’s a beautiful scene and from the off, it’s where I’ve wanted to anchor the book. Similar moments occur for funerals of Michael J, Catherine Casey and Austie. Other group scenes include the Christmas Parties and, coming in the other direction, the workers’ strike in maybe 1948, where they demanded better conditions. This brought in Tom Kyne TD, and possiby the Dail, and they were defo included a year later when</em></p>

<li><p>“A signal honour has been paid to the town of Dungarvan today. The minister has come here to officially open our factory, and his Lordship the Bishop of Waterford has come to impart God’s blessing upon our industry. On your behalf and on that of the people of Dungarvan, I wish to thank those distinguished gentlemen”</p></li>
<li><p>“Hear, hear”</p></li>
<li><p>“The establishment in Dungarvan of the important factory is due mainly to the efforts made by the members of the Dungarvan Industrial Devopment Association, working unselfishly in the interests of their native town and of the townspeople. In referreint to the DIDC, I wish to make special reference to the work of the Chairman, Rev Father (T B) Walsh and to the members of the committee, including Dr Michael Casey and PJ Molony. [Patrick J Moloney Managing director of A. Moloney and Son<strong>s.]</strong></p></li>
<li><p>These gentlemen and other members of the committee, to my knowlege, spent many weary months in an effort to secure for the town a suitable industry that would provide much neeede employment. I think everyboyd will agree that their efforts have been successful.</p></li>
<li><p>[Speaking from a life of experience, he wrote] The industry is a highly technical one, there is a very large market available within the Irish Free State for its products, [The first and most difficult period of the company’s history had now passed] and employment is given to over 100 male workers to whom good wages are paid.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>[include the wage bill here – maybe £300 per week, to be converted to modern money for comparison, but ideally with a list of what that could buy</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>I should like to express appreciation to those who invested the necessary capital to permit this industry to be started, said Mr O’Brien. I can assue them that it is now firmly establised, that the company’s prospects are, in my opinion, most favourable, and that their interestes will be looked after, to the best of our ability, by me and my co-directors.</p></li>
<li><p>A tribute must be paid to the employees. The managing director has told me that they have adapted themselves very quickly to the training facilities offered to them, and have worked willingly and loyally in the interests of the company.</p></li>
<li><p>The establishment of this industry has been brought about as a result of the industrial policy of the Government, which has as its object the making of this country self-sufficient, and by the creation of industries for the manufacture of the rquirements of the country, giving much-needed employment. From what I have already told you, I think you will agree that this object has been achieved so far as the factory in Dungarvan is concerned.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>IP: <span class="citation" data-cites="while">@while</span> there might be a feeling of disappointment that a large part of the industrial field was still untilled, very few people were disposed to think that the industrial enterprises set going since the present government took office would ever fall is adequately supported byt heir own opein. And that support, in my opinion, is likely to be forthcoming in ever-increasing measure in the future”</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>As an example of what has been achieved in the leather industry, said Mr O’Brien, I am asking th Minister to accept a pair of slippers. The upper leather of these slippers has been manufactured from native Irish sheepskin tanned in our factory here in Dungaravan; the sole and insold leather from native cow-hide tanned in the neighbouring factory in Portlaw; the lasts on which they have been manufactured were made in the recently established factory in Newbridge [lasts are a wooden form on which the leather upper of a shoe is shaped.], and the manufacture of the slippers themselvers was carried out by the well-known and old-establihsed firm of boot and show manufacturers of Messrs Hearne and Cahill, Waterford. The slippers are presented not for their intrinsic valude as a memento of the work done in the establishment and development of Irish industries by the Minister for Industry and commerce.</p></li>
<li><p>Applause</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Find out the yeas in which each of these factories was established</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Just another day at the office for Lemass<br>
This is where the cartoon ought to go</strong></p>
<p>Replying to the toast, Mr Lemass said thay they had gathered from the newspaper reports that he frequeently had occasion to attend functions like that, and for one holding the position fo Minister for Industry and Commerce it was always a pleasure to be present at such function, but the pleasure was not entirely an unmixed one, because as time passed it became increasingly difficult to say something original. This was the first occasion he was able to visit Dungarvan for a number of years, and he was very glad that the occasion was one associated with the establishment of an industry in the town, [with characteristic vision, he continued] a<strong>n industry that would not merely be of considerable benefit to the town at present, but offers considerable prospects of development for the future</strong>, enabling it to extend its roll of its employees, enlarge the sum which is distributed in weekly wages, and thus extending the trade of the town, and help to add to its presperity, and promote the general business activities of the town.</p></li>
<li><p>If there is one reason more than another why I am please to be associated with this enterprise, he said, is because in the best and truest sense of the term this is a local enterprise.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Of course there was a swathe of outsiders with their fingers in this local pie (Dickens, O’Brien, Crowley)</strong></li>
</ol></li>
<li></li>
<li><p>Mr Lemass continued that the history of the establishment of this factory in Dungarvan would be a source of benefit to the citizens of other towns in the Free State, in which factories of a similar nature had not yet been set up, and where the volume of demand for such a factory had grown in persistence. [e.g.&nbsp;Carrick-on-Suir for leather, but plenty more other factories]. He was glad that a tribute had been paid to the local committee because the factory would not have been established at all only for their efforts.</p></li>
<li><p>At some stage a factory such as this would have been set up in the country, but not necessarily by the compnay which was no operating here, and certainly not in Dungarvan, were it not for the work of the local committee, of which he had personal evidence a long time ago. [Walsh, Casey, Molony et al] <strong>They set out to establish an industry here and very quickly established contact with teh Department and he was glad that they were able to assiste them. Again, the company was formed and finance without outside assistance, underwriting facilities or any other financial help, as was due not alone to the promoters but to the good citizenship of the people of Dungaravvan and the locality,</strong> and he did not think that at any time they would have reaon to regret what they had done and the investment they had made. This industry, like all new industries, had to overcome difficulties, had (?)not been surmounted and the company was progressing very satisfactorily indeed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Damn the begrudgers</strong></p>
<p>Speaking on the industrial development of the country, the Minister said that what had been said, written and through about the industrial future of this country in past years, was nonsense and was used by those who had vested interests in maintaining the old position. When the opportunity was given for developing the industrial position of the country that opportunity was availed of not by the people of one party or one class, but was availed of by a large numer of people in the country, many of whom differed fundamentally in matters of political policy in other directions.</p></li>
<li><p>“In these days of economic stress”, said Mr Lemass, “We are all naturally perturbed at the continued existence of unemployment on a wide scale, and emigration, which stopped for a short time, and is now resumed”</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Need to check stats on that. The issue being that there were no jobs abroad now to emigrate to</li>
<li>No one emigrated to America</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>He was sure that most thinking people realised that the problem of unemployment and the problem of emigration were both the same, and the social evils to which they gave rise could not be terminated without the greatest degree of industrial development that circumstances would permit.</p></li>
<li><p>“Irrespective of the opintions we might hold on a wide variety of things,” said Mr Lemass, “there is no substantion section of our people who do not know the urgency of industrial development so that people might be given more employment and a wider variety of employment”</p></li>
<li><p>The minister continued by saying that if they could secure the maximum of industrial development, and secure at the same time that needs of the people in housing were adequately catered for, they could usefully occupy the labour of every unemployed man amongst them.</p></li>
<li><p>Concluding, the Minister said that they had a number of economoic problems for soluation and a very large number of of social evils to terminate. He trusted that the succes which had met the efforts of the local committed in Dungaravan, which resulted in giving employment to more than one hundred men in the town who would otherwise be idle or forced to emigrate, would encourage other committees in the country to make a special effort to solve their own problems, and he could assure them that if they had any practical plans they could rely on the cooperation of not merely the Dept of INdustry and Commerce, but of every Government department</p></li>
<li><p>Applause</p></li>
<li><p>Other Toasts<br>
Proposing the toast of ‘The Company’, Rev Fr Walsh, BA, CC, Dungarvan said that the products of the factory had entered most of the homes of this country. [(t was a matter of nationwide significance. The minister had spoken very highly of them, and it was very kind of him. The local Industrical Development Committe had done as far as it could its best. That day they had seen a body of men at the factory engaged in manufacture, with the knowledge that they were not distributing foreing goods, but engaged in the noble work of making goods for consumption by the Irish people. <strong>The best bulwark the clergy have against Communism, or any other ism”</strong>, said Father Walsh, “the best guarantee of fidelity we have is the contented working man.”</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>He concluded by saying that they were deeply indebted to Mr Dickens, who had come there to teach them about the business to which he had given a lifetime.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Supporting the toast, Mr EA Ryan, State Solicitor, said they had taken part in what he considered to be a very momentous event that day. They were there representing as they did <strong>a part of a living generation of Irishmen and women and have taken ……. what has been one of the most extraordinary political and economic revoluations in the history of the world,</strong> and developing towards what he hoped would be <strong>the complete and absolute political and economic freedom of this country.</strong> That might sound extraordinary to some people, but it was a natural expression of thought on his part. Referring to the fishing industry, he said that <strong>the town was once a great fishing town</strong>, and he could remember in his boyhood days seeing fifty or sixty crafts at the quays, and he hoped that in the near future something would again be done for that industry. [ there are numerous young men who could fin employment int he fishing industry and he hoped that somethign would be done for them]</p></li>
<li><p>MR R Dickens, replying to the toast, said that he had taken on a job of work, and he intended to see it through. He paid tribute to the wonderful cooperation he had received from the people of Dungarvan. [he was grateful for the consideration which he had receieved from the MinistRY of Industry and Commerce]</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The toast of “Our Guests” was proposed by Dr M Casey, who, in doing so, said that he wnated to see more people employed in the town, and he wanted to see Dungarvan and the whole of the county prosperous.</strong> [the opening of the factory was a work for the betterment ofthe people of the country and was memorable event int he history of the borough of Dungarvan].</p></li>
<li><p>Very Reverand Canon O’Brien, supporting the toast, said that the prosperity of the town was undoubtedly growing. [the happiest relations existed between the men employed and the management of the factory] <em>(a situation that wsa not to last)</em></p></li>
<li><p>Mrs Redmond, TD, replying to the toast, said that Dungarvan and Waterford as a whole had suffered much in recent years, and, therefore, it was very good to see this industry established. Money and expense had not been thought about in establishing the industry, and she could see no reason why the factory should not have a prosperous future. [she hoped that the new industry would eb the forerunner of others to come in Dungarvan] <em>how many women TDs were there</em></p></li>
<li><p>Mr PJ LIttle, TD, also replied to the toast, the <strong>proceedings closed with the singing of the National Anthem by all present</strong>.</p></li>
