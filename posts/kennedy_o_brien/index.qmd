title: "Kennedy O'Brien and the Portlaw Tannery"
---

Kennedy O’Brien was one of the few *bona fide* leather men left in Ireland during the 1920s by which time the tanning industry had dwindled almost entirely out of existence. Yet over the next few decades he helped to build up the industry more than any other person on the ground and his story is an interesting contrast to his colleague, Austie Casey, because O'Brien was focussed single-mindedly on leather and nothing else, and he also lived longer to see out his ambitions.

Kennedy O'Brien grew up in Limerick, the son of pig buyer also called Kennedy O’Brien. *Kennedy* was a given name that went back for generations in that branch of the family and census records of 1911 show eleven men in Ireland of that name, possibly all them related as most of them were in the Limerick area, and only one lived improbably far away. There might have been even more *Kennedy O'Briens*, only the Catholic Church didn’t like children to be baptised with anything other than a saint’s name, although family lore claims that there was a cheeky way of twisting the church's arm. Our Kennedy's father simply told the Parish Priest that if he didn't let his son be baptised with the preferred name, then the child would be brought round the corner and baptised a Protestant. This did the trick and thus the curious, heavy-duty, forename lived on.

Our Kennedy O'Brien was aged 22 at the 1911 census, making him a full decade older than Austie, and much closer to the emerging power opportunities afforded by the emergence of the new state. He was listed as an accountant but may have already begun working in O'Callaghan's Tannery in Limerick City, the last surviving large-scale tannery on the island. The owner, who was also the **mayor** of Limerick, approached the young man with the offer of a job. O'Brien already had a job lined up in Dublin and was due to begin a few months later. But O'Callaghan said he needed someone to help him estimate the number of hides needed in the factory, and that the clever young man was free to leave when his other job was ready to start. But O'Brien had found his place in the world and spent the rest of his life selling and making leather, as well as spawning a handful of sons who followed him into the trade.

Having established himself within the Limerick tannery buildings, and built the trust of his boss, O'Brien was given a car and sent out to sell O'Callaghan's leather to the shoemakers and shoe repair shops of Ireland – all thirty-two counties, as partition was yet to be implemented. This constant movement suited his restless nature but it also gave him a great appreciation of the needs of the Irish people, their need for more employment, and the country's need for a native tanning industry, rather than importing almost all of its leather from Britain.

In 1927, O'Brien set up his own business as a wholesale leather merchant, on 27 North Frederick St in Dublin City, and that building would become the centre of operations for his ever-expanding leather empire.

It is not clear exactly when O'Brien became friendly with Sean Lemass, but it might have been through his brother Bartholemew O'Brien, who was a gun runner during the revolutionary years. Their father, Kennedy Sr, bought and sold pigs in Limerick, and it became Bart's job to walk around with a cart and amass pig swill from the local hotels. This noxious task proved to be the ideal cover for transporting guns because they could be wrapped and placed beneath the swill. And if he was stopped by the police of the auxiliaries, none of them would swirl their hand through the filthy pit of used food. And while this method of transportation befuddled the authorities for a time, word must have leaked out because Bart was tipped off that they were on his case, so he fled to New York where he got a job with the Pinkerton Detective agency and, thanks to his free transport pass, he resumed his gun-running acitivities, only at the other end of the chain.

Having Lemass's ear would prove most invaluable once the Fianna Fail government took control of the country in 1932 and set out their twin policies of protectionism and decentralization which led to the establishment of so many factories around the towns and even villages of Ireland. The choice of a settlement as small as Portlaw might seem odd for such a large operation. One requirement was easy access to a port (Waterford) as tanning agents had to be imported from around the globe. But Dr D.J. Dwyer (1962: 180) considers Portlaw something of a prototypical choice for a tannery, as it is an obnoxious industry that is better suited to a rural location with lots of water. Water is needed for both the tanning itself and for getting rid of effluent – however unsatisfactory that might be to modern sensibilities. The Portlaw tannery sts on a bend on the River Clodiagh, a tributary of the River Suir, a site that was used in the nineteenth century for the cotton mill run by a Quaker family. Indeed, when the tannery opened up, a former employee of the mill, aged 94, showed up and demanded to be given a job in his old haunt.

It turns out that Lemass was, in the end, somewhat regretful at having chosen Portlaw as the site of the first tannery. His decision was based on two under-estimations of the coming demand for leather in the newly self-sufficient state. The first estimate of 225,000 hides *per annum* was made by government officials and the second estimate of 300,000 was made by Vincent Crowley, a Dublin-based solicitor who would become Chairman of Irish Tanners and also the accountant for Dickens Leather.

Kennedy O'Brien was certainly the man for the job as he knew the industry better than anyone. He became a director and general manager of the company known as Irish Tanners, which means that he ran the day to day operations. The Chairman was the solicitor Vincent Crowley and the secretary was Dr Jeremiah Dempsey, one of Crowley's employees. As with Dickens Leather, the managing director was an Englishman called HG Barlow who was presumably the man identified by Mary Daly as the tariff-jumping "British entrepreneur who already owned Western Tanning of Bristol and Redvales Ltd. of Bury." Interestingly, Reginald Dickens was also in attendance at the opening of the Portlaw tannery, as was Austie Casey.

Portlaw focussed on hard leather soles for shoes, taken from tougher cowhides, whereas Dungarvan focused on soft leathers taken from sheepskins, and once the first tannery was set up, O'Brien was quick to get involved in the second, and he became the Chairman of of Dickens Leather, while Crowley was the accountant, keeping his finger in the pie.

Managing Portlaw remained O'Brien's primary focus, and by 1957 it was said to be the sixth largest tannery in the world.

but as his sons grew up and became able to take on ever more of the family business, he was able to set up something of a corridor of his own tanneries stretching between Dublin and Waterford. The first of these was in Gorey (**1936**) and lat**er in Milford, Co Carlow (1948), Rathangan, Co Kildare and Carnew, Co Wicklow.** Meanwhile, his operations in Dublin continued to grow. He had a team of ladies on one floor cutting upper leathers for the shoe repairmen of Dublin and another team producing metal parts for working boots. Most memorably, however, he began producing football boots and running shoes, and provided Ronny Delany with his footwear when he won an Olympic Gold medal in the 1500m in Melbourne in 1956, Ireland's first gold medal since 1932, and the first to be televised. However, this era was to be the golden age of Irish leather production, and the Kayobee brand in use, taken from Kennedy O'Brien's initials, had no chance of ever gaining the worldwide popularity of other shoe manufacturers.
