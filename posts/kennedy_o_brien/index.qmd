title: "Kennedy O'Brien"
---

Kennedy O’Brien was one of the few *bona fide* leather men left in Ireland during the 1920s when the tanning industry had dwindled out of almost existence. Yet over the next few decades he helped to build up the industry more than any other person on the ground and his story is an interesting contrast to his colleague, Austie Casey, because O'Brien was focussed single-mindedly on leather and nothing else, and he lived longer to see out his ambitions.

Kennedy O'Brien grew up in Limerick, the son of pig buyer also called Kennedy O’Brien. *Kennedy* was a given name that went back for generations in that branch of the family and census records of 1911 show eleven men in Ireland of that name, most of them in the Limerick area, and none living improbably far away. There might have been yet more *Kennedy O'Briens*, only the Catholic Church didn’t like children to be baptised with anything other than a saint’s name, although family lore claims that there was a cheeky way of twisting the church's arm. Our Kennedy's father simply told the Parish Priest that if he didn't let his son be baptised with the preferred name, then the child would be brought round the corner and baptised a Protestant. This would do the trick and thus the curious, heavy-duty, forename lived on.

Our Kennedy was aged 22 at the 1911 census, making him a full decade older than Austie, and much closer to the emerging power opportunities afforded by the new state. He was listed as an accountant but may have already begun working in O'Callaghan's Tannery in Limerick City, the last surviving large-scale tannery on the island. The owner, who was also the **mayor** of Limerick, approached the young man with the offer of a job. O'Brien already had a job lined up in Dublin and was due to begin a few months later. But O'Callaghan said he needed someone to help him estimate the number of hides needed in the factory, and that the clever young man was free to leave when his other job was ready to start. O'Brien had found his place in the world and spent the rest of his life selling and making leather, as well as spawning a handful of sons who followed him into the trade.

Having established himself in the tannery buildings, and built the trust of his boss, O'Brien was given a car and sent out to sell O'Callaghan's leather to the shoemakers and shoe repair shops of Ireland, all thirty-two counties, as partition was yet to be implemented. This constant movement suited his restless nature but it also gave him a great appreciation of the needs of the Irish people, their need for more employment, and the country's need for a native tanning industry, rather than importing almost all of its leather from Britain.

In 1927, O'Brien set up his own business as a wholesale leather merchant, on 27 North Frederick St in Dublin City, and that building would become the centre of operations for his ever-expanding leather empire.

It is not clear exactly when O'Brien became friendly with Sean Lemass, but it might have been through his brother Bartholemew O'Brien, who was a gun runner during the revolutionary years. Their father, Kennedy Sr, bought and sold pigs in Limerick, and it became Bart's job to walk around with a cart and amass pig swill from the local hotels. This noxious task proved to be the ideal cover for transporting guns because they could be wrapped and placed beneath the swill. And if he was stopped by the police of the auxiliaries, none of them would swirl their hand through the filthy pit of used food. And while this method of transportation befuddled the authorities for a time, word must have leaked out because Bart was tipped off that they were on his case, so he fled to New York where he got a job with the Pinkerton Detective agency and, thanks to his free transport pass, he resumed his gun-running acitivities, only at the other end of the chain.

he was certainly whispering in his ear by the time nation was becoming self-sufficient.

Family man - each of them got a bit of the business too

A real family business
