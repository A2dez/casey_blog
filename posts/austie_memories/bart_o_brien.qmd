I never heard whether Kennedy himself was i**nvolved in the Brigade**s, and **certainly not what he got up to after,** but he did tell me a good one about the brother, Bart I think he said his name was. You see their father used to buy and sell pigs in Limerick and it was Bart's job to walk around with the cart and amass pig swill from the local hotels to feed the pigs. CAn you imagine. If you thought the leather factory was smelly! But it turned out it was a great one for moving guns around the city. They'd come in somewhere off the coast and into the city and your man would wrap them up and put them beneath the swill. And if he was stopped by the Tans or the Auxiliaries, none of them was ever going to swirl their arm through the swill. Now the authorities didn't know what was going on for ages but they must've got wind because someone tipped off the Bart and he was gone like a flash to The States. I wonder if Dicky ever got to know him. You see it wasn't long before he was back to his old tricks. He joined the Pinkerton Detective agency and that give him free transport all over I believe, and

-   And did he ever come home?

-   No, Kennedy said he got the Spanish Flu and that was the end of him. Buried in The States

-   It is not clear exactly when Kennedy O'Brien became friendly with Sean Lemass, and

-   it is not clear if perhaps O'Brien was involved at all in the Republican movement.

-   His father seems to have been sympathetic

-   and his brother is known to have been actively involved as a gun runner during the revolutionary years.

-   Their father, Kennedy Sr, bought and sold pigs in Limerick,

    -   and it became Bart's job to walk around with a cart and amass pig swill from the local hotels.

    -   This noxious task proved to be the ideal cover for transporting guns because they could be wrapped and placed beneath the swill.

    -   And if he was stopped by the police of the auxiliaries, none of them would swirl their hand through the filthy pit of used food.

    -   And while this method of transportation befuddled the authorities for a time, word must have leaked out because Bart was tipped off that they were on his case,

    -   so he fled to New York where he got a job with the Pinkerton Detective agency and, thanks to his free transport pass, he resumed his gun-running acitivities, only at the other end of the chain.
