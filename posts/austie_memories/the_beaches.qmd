**Bitches in the Beaches**

**Beaches Brew**

There she is again now at her window. Miss Havisham must be gone out with those silly little dogs. Oh Lordy when is she ever going to stop looking at me? It's a good thing she's not in the nip again. Mind you that's the best part of her 😉. The bit that hasn't rotted away like her sorry soul, God love her. And there she is now with her vacant eyes, staring at me, haunting me. Making me relive and pay for my long and flippant youth. I was only playing, silly girl. We were young. Did you not know? Begob, I was a terror for the ladies. A terror to them too it seems. And now she lies there all day in her bed, inconsolable. Praying for my death no doubt. Well she's getting what she wished for. But I'm getting a lot more. Those yelps all night echoing across the yard. And it's all my fault, is it? Arrant nonsense. So I did wrong by her. Led her on a little. But what fella doesn't take what he's given? The bed doesn't do them any favours. Just lets them brood and brood. I'd rather my fate than hers, burning out while she fades away under the quilts. Living out her obligatory life. Thank God I got Anne in the end, after all those false starts.

I wonder if the fellas working below know what goes on above their head?

Beloved sweetheart bastard. Not a day since then\
I haven’t wished him dead. Prayed for it\
so hard I’ve dark green pebbles for eyes,\
ropes on the back of my hands I could strangle with.

Spinster. I stink and remember. Whole days\
in bed cawing Nooooo at the wall; the dress\
yellowing, trembling if I open the wardrobe;\
the slewed mirror, full-length, her, myself, who did this

to me? Puce curses that are sounds not words.\
Some nights better, the lost body over me,\
my fluent tongue in its mouth in its ear\
then down till I suddenly bite awake. Love’s

hate behind a white veil; a red balloon bursting\
in my face. Bang. I stabbed at a wedding cake.\
Give me a male corpse for a long slow honeymoon.\
Don’t think it’s only the heart that b-b-b-breaks.
