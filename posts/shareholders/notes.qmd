Aisling Conroy / Eddie Cantwell / Cork Examiner Opening Ceremony report

Dickens Leather Co. obtained a virtual monopoly of the Free State market for its products and future prospects looked bright. Incorporated on 23rd October 1935 there was great interest generated in this new tan- nery project. Of its nominal capital of £40,000, £24,000 was issued. The issue of shares was closed within a few minutes of the opening and the sum asked for was even oversubscribed.

**Financial context**

-   Context
-   500k pairs of shoes were worth £318k (ex-factory)
-   so for £2 you could get three pairs of shoes
-   Or for one share you could get a pair of shoes and one unpaired shoe. Now, the exchange rate says that a pound then is worth about E70 now, itself about the price of a pair of shoes, although certainly not the prices of a pair of strong leather boots or anythign like it. So my feeling is that the things you bought would be

<!-- -->

-   Dickens got the first half cos it’s his business
-   Directors got the final 2k
-   1-6000 Reginald Dickens
-   6001-10000 Sundry
-   10001-11000 Kennedy O’Brien
-   11001-12000 Austie Casey
-   What about Molony?

**Missing Data:**

-   626 + 2 + 70
-   Pages 12-16 with a max of 10 shareholders
-   shares 7067-7693 (626 shares)

**There is no evidence that a bunch of people bought 1 share apiece.**

For some reason Austie flogged a buncha shares at Xmas ‘35,

-   123 bought by RJC and

-   50 by William F O’Keeffe (with no address or profession).

    -   My guess is that they lent them to Austie who had to give them back

    -   but did that affect his directorship?

<!-- -->

-   Was he skint?
    -   Did the list of directors change? What about Max Davis

<!-- -->

-   Dickens owns it,
-   clearly investing in Ireland post-Economic War
-   Kennedy O’Brien
-   Leather merchant
-   Michael Casey & Patrick Moloney
-   Dungarvan people
-   Sundry punters round the country
-   Martin Melly Sligo
-   PJ Merriman, Cork
-   Kennelly Kerry
-   Francis Early, Leitrim
-   Fennessys\]

Some directors held no shares at all—especially:

-   accountants

-   solicitors

-   technical experts

-   government‑appointed directors

-   managers promoted internally
