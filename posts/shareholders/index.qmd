![*The treemap displays the number of shares for each shareholder. Reginald Dickens owned half of the 6000 shares, while directors had at least 500. Austie Casey had 1000.*](images/shareholders_treemap_1.png)

*The following is taken from an initial analysis of the ledger book, and lots of details need to be clarified on further inspection.*

-   Nominal capital of £40000, £24000 was issues

    -   50% preferential

    -   50% ordinary

One of the most important documents to survive from Dickens Leather is the Share Ledger which keeps track of the 12000 ordinary shares issued.

-   Unfortunately, there is no record of the preferential shares sold and these may have have attracted a larger number of small investors who were new to the game, riding the feel-good wave of the freshly ambitious state.

Most importantly, we see that Reginald Dickens owned exactly half of the shares (numbered 1-6000) and this would have been the most he was allowed to own, in accordance with the new laws, as he was not a citizen of Ireland. The directors come next, with 1000 shares reserved for Kennedy O'Brien (10001-11000) and Austie Casey (11001-12000).

-   The other local director, Joe Molony had just 500, and his pile (7814-8313) is plucked from the middle, rather than being reserved. Yet is clear from the numbers that his were bought alongside those of the family business, A Moloney and Sons Ltd (7694-7813).

-   What is most interesting about the shares of Kennedy O'Brien and Austie Casey is that each of them had a chunk of shares redistributed not long after the initial shares were sold. Within a year of issue, O'Brien had his allotment split and given to a Max Davis, a Dublin-based businessman whose profession is listed as "Company Director".

    -   It may be the case the O'Brien had to borrow the money off Davis in order to satisfy the expectations attached to being a director and chairman.

    -   Over the next decade, O'Brien bought amassed further 1000 **(ish - count**) shares, bringing his total count back up to 1500. This suggests that O'Brien was reinvesting the profits of his other businesses into Dickens Leather, even as his day-to-day influence receded into the background **(check)**.

-   As for Austie Casey, 123 of his allotment were given to his older brother Richard, within a couple of months, and this may well be evidence of another loan. While locals may have been willing to have (effectively) made small loans to their local doctor, the more worldly priest must have wanted a longer-term cut of the proceeeds, and over the next two decades, Richard would amass another 675 shares, making him one of the biggest shareholders. Where exactly he got this money is yet to be determined.

-   Beyond the directors, shares were split among a combination of Dungarvan businessmen and a smattering of professionals from around the country. Fortunately, the shareholders' professions are listed, along with their addresses, so we can see who from Dungarvan and who was from further afield.

-   Among the Dungarvan people we have:

    -   A. Molony and Sons 130, a local business who had an award-winning bakery and fingers in several other local pies, including the Urban district council and the FF cumainn. *In 1932, his bread won a Silver medal at the London Baking and Trade Exhibition.*

    -   K Williams Co Ltd (100)

    -   Miss Margaret Anne Phelan (100)

    -   Pierce Casey (75)

    Question: did individual locals have preferential shares or did Austie keep them all for himself?

and where they live. Reginald Dickens (from England, in forest green) owned 6000 of the 12000 ordinary shares. Dungarvan people (purple), including the directors Michael Casey and Joe Molony, accounted for c.3500 of the shares, and the remainder were held in Dublin (lime green)\* or elsewhere.
