Opening scene, potentially

Austie is in bed and Laura Anne (aged 2) has come in and is bouncing on the bed. Austie is in awful **Yet to be identified** pain so he calls Michael (8) to come and help him get rid of Lala. Not sure where Jane and Richard are – if anywhere. Ann is in bed pregnant and not well

**Notes - Austie could die before he tells the full story**

**What curse of pain would he use? (e.g. Lord of Mercy)**

Next - breakfast in bed and someone will come in to start talking to Austie to hear his story

-- Ah, Lala, leave me alone, you little rascal.

-- Bounce, bounce, bounce! Daddy! I bouncing. I bouncing.

-- Michaeeeel! Oof. **Lordamercy**, the pain. Michael. Would you ever take your little sister or tell your nanny to take her.

-- Morning, Daddy.

-- Morning, laddie. You're very good. How's your Mammy this morning?

-- She's the same. **add pain detail** She misses you.

**Austie will be sentimental here. He'll want to hear something nice about Michael. About something little Michael loves - something that will help Austie die in peace, knowing he has raised a good little boy.** Jesus I'm in tears now
