    "text": "Splendid new leather factory\n\nMonday, May 3, 1937\n\n\n\nMinister Sean Lemass meets Austie Casey at the opening of Dickens Leather\n\n\nThe opening of Dickens Leather Factory, on Monday, 3 September, 1937 was a special day in the town’s history and it gives us the ideal opportunity to get introduced to the characters in the story and to understand who was who when the factory opened. Officially opened, that is, because the factory was already up and running for fully twelve months (GET DATES) and, given the circumstances, that was the hard part done, as we shall see.\nThe ceremony began with the arrival of Minister Sean Lemass, who was yet again made Minister of Industry and Commerce in the new Dáil of July 1937, where Fianna Fail rubberstamped their authority on the The Irish Free State, winning exactly 50% of seats, before reconstituting the state by the end of the year. Lemass had been most successful in his first ministerial term, opening up countless new factories around the state, including County Waterford’s other leather factory in the village of Portlaw.\nLemass alighted in Abbeyside, the village across the bridge from Dungarvan Town, and he we was met by a local priest and most of the directors of Dickens Leather. Fr T.B. Walsh was the Chairman of the Dungarvan Industrial Development Association, a group that included two local, Dr Michael Augustine Casey and Patrick J. Molony, the managing director of A. Molony and Sons (shipping?)This team had agitated hard to get the factory into Dungarvan and the factory in Portlaw proved to be a complementary stepping stone, in terms of both personnel and output. Portlaw’s produce was mostly based on hard cowhide leather, used in the soles of the shoes, whereas Dungarvan’s produce was mostly based on softer sheepskin leather, used for upper parts of the shoe and inner linings. Their leadership groups were also hugely overlapping. The Chairman of Dickens Leather was Mr Kennedy O’Brien who was becoming something leather baron across Ireland. He was CHAIR? of Portlaw, and his core business was as leather merchant in Dublin City. And the Managing Director was the eponymous Reginald Dickens from England, and his family’s core business was in Northampton, the most famous city in the world for leather and shoe production. Dungarvan and Portlaw, for him, were side ventures from his main business, run by Reginald and his brothers, and by their father before them since 1897.\nThe town was ready for its big day and once the men of influence had assembled, the triumphal procession could begin to slither through the freshly decorated streets, to the roars of the crowd, as cheer after cheer rent the air. Varicoloured bunting festooned the main streets and large banners welcomed the Minister to the town. The local Gardaí formed a bodyguard for Lemass and the parade was fronted by the Waterford Brass and Reed band playing familiar airs, many with a nationalistic bent, for the day was an expression of both national and local pride. The crowd filed in behind them like mass-goers forming a queue for communion and, on arrival at Quay Street, they were met by the hundred-plus men who worked in the factory nearby, at The Lookout, looking out at the wide expanse of Dungarvan Bay.\nA temporary stand was erected and Lemass was greeted by Kennedy O’Brien in his capacity of Chairman of Dickens Leather. Meanwhile, the band played the National Anthem while the deep crowds looked on. Several welcoming addresses were made. First up were The Urban District Council and then Father Walsh himself. Not one, but two local Fianna Fail groups gave an address: the Padraig Pearse Cumann and the Cathal Brugha Cumannn and, finally, an unidentified of the factory’s workforce said some words, with no name given by any of the newspaper reports.\nThe last public address was made by Lemass himself. He thanked and congratulated the above-mentioned men of power, the workers and his Fianna Fail colleagues in the Cumainn, but also spoke the crowd themselves, noting the importance of the factory in generating employment and prosperity to the locality.\nAfterwards, O’Brien presented Lemass with a symbolic gold key to the factory, and, with the church and local government and the politicians having all had their say, and with the band playing Faith of Fathers, it was time for the factory to be blessed solemnly by His Lordship, The Most Reverand Doctor Jeremiah Kinane, Bishop of Waterford and Lismore, ably assisted by the Parish Priest, The Very Reverand T. Canon O’Brien, and his curate, the above-mentioned Reverand TB Walsh.\nAfterwards, Dickens gave the Bishop and Minister a guided tour of inspection of the factory\n\nThe factory was left open for the local hoards to investigate and one wonders how well supervised the machines were with children running round.\nLater in the day, Lemass would point out how great it was that the factory was a truly local venture – and it certainly was for the staff employed in the factory. But the reality is that the directors were a mix of locals (Austie Casey and Joe Molony) with bigger fish.\nIn July 1937, Fianna Fail had yet again won the general election, and were continuing their policy of applying huge tariffs on imported goods, a policy which facilitated the growth of an unprecendented number of mid-sized factories around the state. Sean Lemass was again the Minister of Industry and Commerce, a position he would hold between 1932 and 1959 for for sixteen intermittent years.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "1830s Peak\nThe emergence of a leather industry in 1930s Ireland was akin to a resurrection from a long and painful death. The previous hundred years had seen a steady decline of a once-flourishing native industry. The peak was in the 1820s and ’30s around the time that livestock began to be exported en masse to Britain, thanks to improvements in sea communications, and thus there fewer and fewer hides available for tanning. In 1837 there were 46 tanneries in the city of Cork alone, tanning over 2000 hides per week. and employing 625 people, which is more people than were employed across the twenty-six counties at the height of the resurrection in the 1950s. To grasp the proliferation of the industry in comparison, it may be instructive to compare it to sports clubs in the modern day. Currently, there are 225 GAA clubs in the county of Cork alone, and over 1600 hundred on the island, whereas there are just 109 rugby clubs on the island, many of them clustered in a few hubs. And just as almost every parish nowadays has its own GAA club, every town and village in pre-famine Ireland would have had a tanyard, alongside at least one person making shoes and another repairing them.\nDecline\nBy 1852, after The Great Hunger had destroyed the nation, there were still 26 tanneries in Cork City, although few of them were operating full-time as demand for leather had understandably dropped and credit was scarce so the businesses couldn’t get back on their feet. By 1902, there were just three tanneries in Cork and just 18 across the entire island of Ireland. In 1923, when a Free State report was commissioned, there were just five. The only large-scale operation was Callaghans in Limerick City, tanning 200 hides per week, and small operation in Thomastown, Clonmel, Ballitore and New Ross, tanning just 100 hiders per week between them. In total, these tanneries were supplying on one twentieth of the state’s demand for leather, so the other 95% had to be imported. Even so, New Ross would close down the following year.\nThe reasons for the decline of the leather industry thus provide us with something of a microcosm of the problems that Ireland faced during the tragic century between the 1820s and 1920s. A tannery needs two things more than anything else: animal skins and dyes for tanning, and both of these were being purged from the country. Livestock were shipped to Britain in ever-increasing numbers and with them vanished the jobs associated with processing the animals, such as butchering the flesh and tanning the skins. Meanwhile, dyes taken from oak bark were becoming harder to source due to deforestation, although by our time of interest, different dyes were being used. A completely different, and preventable problem, was in how duties were levied on tanners. In England, tanners paid duty on every hide processed whereas in Ireland they paid duty on the pits used for processing them, so too many hides would be processed in the one pit, resulting in lower quality leather being made throughout Ireland, and thus greater demand for leather imported from across the pond. Finally, there was little hope of any Irish tanneries exporting leather to Britain, seeing as Britain imposed a 60% tariff on Irish leather but there was only a 10% tariff in the opposite direction.\nShoots of growth\nBetween 1922 and 1932, there was no improvement in the leather industry, although there was a little growth in the footwear industry and these helped paved the way for native leather production which could then be used as a raw material for footwear. In 1924, small tariffs of 15% were introduced on footwear sales in Ireland, but British manufacturers were mostly efficient enough to outprice the emerging batch of Irish producers. However, UK-based businesses began to arrive in The Free State with Edward Donaghy bringing his entire business over the border to Dundalk and, in 1928, John Halliday of Leeds also set up a factory in Dundalk. Later, County Louth would become something of a hub for the Irish footwear industry. The same year, the Irish Tanners Foundation decided that they also wanted some support, so they lodged a case with the newly-formed Tariff Commission, but all they got was a little support in putting tariffs\nThis of course changed with the arrival the Fianna Fail government in 1932",

    "title": "4  Kennedy O’Brien",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Kennedy O’Brien was one of the few bona fide leather men left in early Free State Ireland by which time the tanning industry had dwindled almost entirely out of existence. Yet over the next few decades he helped to build up the industry more than any other person on the ground and his story is an interesting contrast to his colleague-to-be, Austie Casey, because O’Brien was focussed single-mindedly on leather and nothing else, plus he also lived longer to see out his ambitions.\nKennedy O’Brien grew up in Limerick, the son of pig buyer also called Kennedy O’Brien. Kennedy was a given name that went back for generations in that branch of the family and census records of 1911 show eleven men in Ireland of that name, possibly all them related as most of them were in the Limerick area, and only one lived improbably far away. There might have been even more Kennedy O’Briens, only the Catholic Church didn’t like children to be baptised with anything other than a saint’s name, although family lore claims that there was a cheeky way of twisting the church’s arm. Our Kennedy’s father simply told the Parish Priest that if he didn’t let his son be baptised with the preferred name, then the child would be brought round the corner and baptised a Protestant. This did the trick and thus the curious, heavy-duty, forename lived on.\nOur Kennedy O’Brien was aged 22 at the 1911 census, making him a full decade older than Austie. He was listed as an accountant but may have already begun working in O’Callaghan’s Tannery in Limerick City, the last surviving large-scale tannery on the island. He was head-hunted by the Managing Director, Michael O’Callaghan, who would serve as Mayor of Limerick before being murdered in 1921, likely by the Black and Tans or the RIC Auxiliaries.2 But O’Callaghan said he needed someone to help him estimate the number of hides needed in the factory – clearly a job suited to a man of numbers – but O’Brien already had a job lined up in Dublin and was due to begin a few months later. O’Callaghan said that the clever young man was free to leave when his other job was ready to start. O’Brien took the job and clearly found his place in the world as he spent the rest of his life selling and making leather, as well as spawning a handful of sons who followed him into the trade.\nHaving established himself within the Limerick tannery buildings, and built the trust of his boss, O’Brien was given a car and sent out to sell O’Callaghan’s leather to the shoemakers and shoe repair shops of Ireland – all thirty-two counties, as partition was yet to be implemented. This constant movement suited his restless nature and it also gave him a great appreciation of the needs of the Irish people, their need for more employment, and the country’s need for a native tanning industry, rather than importing almost all of its leather from Britain, much of it made from the hides of exported Irish livestock.\nIn 1927, O’Brien set up his own business as a wholesale leather merchant, on 27 North Frederick St in Dublin City, and that building would become the centre of operations for his ever-expanding leather empire. It must have been around this time that he became friendly with Sean Lemass3 who became known for cavorting with city businessmen, playing golf by day or poker at night. Yet cronyism aside, there is unlikely to have been anyone better suited than O’Brien to the task of planning a native tanning industry, between his years of experience, his knowledge of the entire country from his time on the road, and his deep zeal for employment creation. Thus having the Dublin man’s ear would prove most invaluable once the Fianna Fail government took control of the country in 1932 and set out their twin policies of protectionism and decentralization, leading to the establishment of so many factories around the towns of Ireland, big and small. By the mid 1930s, O’Brien’s Dublin business was firmly established, so he would have the time and energy to throw into the Portlaw venture.\nWhy Portlaw?\nThe choice of a settlement as small as Portlaw might seem odd for such a large operation, but DJ Dwyer, in his 1962 study of the Irish Tanning industry, considers it something of a prototypical choice for a tannery. One requirement was easy access to a port (Waterford) as tanning agents had to be imported from around the globe. Secondly, tanneries are better suited to a rural location as the smell and waste are so obnoxious. And finally, there needs to be a lot of water available, coming in and going out of the factory. Water is brought in for the tanning itself and, however unsatisfactory it might be to modern sensibilities, a body of water was needed to dump the untreated waste. Dickens Leather in Dungarvan, located where the Colligan River meets the sea, could take water from the river and dump it into the sea afterwards. The tannery in Gorey had to have a huge waste pipe built, running several miles to the sea, suggesting that politics played a greater role than geography in choosing the town. The Portlaw tannery sat on a bend on the River Clodiagh, a tributary of the River Suir, again providing water on both sides. The site had previously been used for a cotton mill in the nineteenth century, run by a Quaker family. Indeed the town was purpose-built for its workers and, when the tannery finally opened, a former employee of the mill, aged 94, showed up and demanded to be given a job in his old haunt.\nIt turns out that Lemass was, in the end, somewhat regretful at having chosen Portlaw as the site of the first Irish tannery. The town, or perhaps village, was so small that the meal for the opening ceremony in 1935 had to be cooked in Waterford and transported to Portlaw. Fianna Fail might have gained more political traction by putting it into a town with a much larger population – such as Dungarvan – where the staff’s wages could be recirculated more easily, bringing bonhomie to a wider array of voters. Lemass’s choice of Portlaw was informed by government officials who underestimated the coming demand for leather as the state sought self-sufficiency. It quickly became clear that their estimate of 225,000 hides per annum was too low and so was a second estimate of 300,000 hides, made by Vincent Crowley, a Dublin-based solicitor who became Chairman of Irish Tanners and also the accountant for Dickens Leather.\nPersonnel\nWhile the workers in Irish Tanners, Portlaw were local, the management group most certainly weren’t. Kennedy O’Brien became a director and general manager, running the day-to-day operations while his Dublin business ticked over. Crowley was chairman and the secretary was his employee, Dr Jeremiah Dempsey, another city-based professional with his finger in the provincial pie. Despite the name of the tannery, it was actually British-owned and Mary Daly notes this it was registered to the tariff-jumping “British entrepreneur who already owned Western Tanning of Bristol and Redvales Ltd. of Bury.” Presumably, this was HG Barlow, the Managing Director of Irish Tanners, Portlaw’s equivalent of Reginald Dickens who himself was also present at the opening ceremony, along with Dr Austie Casey and many other prominent men of County Waterford.\nIn retrospect, it makes sense to view Portlaw and Dungarvan as complementary businesses, run by an overlapping group of people, especially in the beginning. They were not in direct competition because Portlaw focussed on hard leather soles for shoes, taken from tougher cowhides, whereas Dungarvan would focus on soft leathers taken from sheepskins. We might also think of the Portlaw and Dungarvan tanneries as a three-way compromise between three societal forces. The provincial townspeople did the actual work, capital and industry expertise came from British entrepreneurs (but not the British state), while those based in Dublin functioned as intermediaries between the two.\nHowever, a new law (The Control of Manufacturers Acts 1932-4) introduced by Fianna Fail required that the new industries not have majority control from a foreign company. Irish Tanners was in part funded by the Irish Credit Company, represented at the opening ceremony by its chairman, J.P. Colbert.4 The ICC was formed in 1933 in an effort to fund the new industries popping up around the country, and it is not much of a jump to imagine that the Dungarvan Tannery, with its complementary output, may have been envisioned as being a second branch of Irish Tanners. However, the ICC did not fund Dungarvan – perhaps it ran out of cash – so Irish capital had to be found from somewhere. We shall see in the next chapter that Reginald Dickens owned exactly half of the shares in Dickens Leather, and no capital came from the state. Thus the Irish interest had to be filled by someone, and Austie Casey and Joe Moloney stepped up to the\nManaging Portlaw remained O’Brien’s primary focus, and by 1957 it was said to be the sixth largest tannery in the world, and managed by his son Bartholemew. His sons became ever more involved in the family business, and Kennedy’s urge to create employment and wealth for his family, saw him set up something of a corridor of his own tanneries stretching between Dublin and Waterford. The first of these was in Gorey (1936) and later in Milford, Co Carlow, Rathangan, Co Kildare and Carnew, Co Wicklow. Meanwhile, his operations in Dublin continued to grow. He had a team of ladies on one floor cutting upper leathers for the shoe repairmen of Dublin and another team producing metal parts for working boots, parts which previously had to be imported from England.\nOne final story should illustrate the continued importance of Kennedy O’Brien to the Irish leather industry, and its ultimate demise in the latter part of the twentieth century. Among his many ventures, O’Brien, along with his namesake son, began producing football boots and running shoes, under the brand name Kayobee, taken from their initials. Kayobee shoes were worn in 1956 by Ronny Delany when he won an Olympic Gold medal in the 1500m, Ireland’s first gold medal since 1932, and the first to be televised. The 1950s would turn out to be the high point of the Irish leather industry, before plastics began to be used, and protectionist policies were relaxed, by Lemass himself. Meanwhile, Kayobee shoes, like all regional brands, would be ousted by some of the most iconic brands in the world, and the Irish tanneries slowly faded into oblivion. Our Kennedy O’Brien died in 1959 and his business was liquidated in 1972. The Portlaw tannery, having let go of its staff over several phases, finally closed in 1985 and the derelict factory was finally sold in 2024.",

His father seems to have been sympathetic and his brother is known to have been actively involved as a gun runner during the revolutionary years. Their father, Kennedy Sr, bought and sold pigs in Limerick, and it became Bart’s job to walk around with a cart and amass pig swill from the local hotels. This noxious task proved to be the ideal cover for transporting guns because they could be wrapped and placed beneath the swill. And if he was stopped by the police of the auxiliaries, none of them would swirl their hand through the filthy pit of used food. And while this method of transportation befuddled the authorities for a time, word must have leaked out because Bart was tipped off that they were on his case, so he fled to New York where he got a job with the Pinkerton Detective agency and, thanks to his free transport pass, he resumed his gun-running acitivities, only at the other end of the chain.↩︎\nColbert, John Patrick | Dictionary of Irish Biography↩︎",

    "text": "While Kennedy O’Brien might have been one of the few leathermen in all of Ireland, Reginald Dickens (also born in 1888) was one of several in his own family.1 They ran Dickens Brothers Ltd in Northampton, a city which was firmly at the centre of the leather and footwear industry in Britain and indeed the world. However, with three older brothers ahead of him, two of them a full decade older, Reginald’s best chance of individual success perhaps lay in pastures abroad.\nGrandfather Dickens was a shoe maker in the village of Walgrave, about ten miles outside Northampton, and his son John Dickens, born in 1860, became a leather merchant and a master currier during the 1880s and 90s. Hebegan leather production in the family workshop, but also employed a number of other workers operating from their own backyard workshops. Such small-scale operations had also been common in Ireland in the nineteenth century, but instead of consolidating into larger enterprises in harmony with technological improvements, as they did in Britain, the Irish industry dwindled out of existence thanks in part to the ravaging effects of the famine and the ever-increasing export of livestock ‘on the hoof’ from Ireland to Britain.\nThe Dickens family were of the Baptist persuasion and such non-conformists were disqualified from going to the main English universities. These groups focused on industry and in Ireland this is most familiar among Quaker families such as the Jacobs, the Bewleys and the Odlums. John Dickens doubled up as a lay preacher and was deeply involved in the local Baptist church. He was strict and particularly against the pernicious effects of alcohol. However, he was not shy of work and, being entrepreneurial, he was bound for the nearby city with its shiny opportunities. By 1897, now aged 37, he had established a successful leather business on Victoria St, in the city’s boot and shoe district, where many non-conformists congregated. In 1899 he bought a row of six cottages, had them demolished, and had a purpose-built factory in their place, helped a total of £4000 in loans, split between the bank and his father-in-law, a Mr Pebody. The factory was operational the following year but, sadly, John died in 1903. Like Michael J Casey, he had five sons and one daughter. The eldest two, Arnold and Alfred, took over the business, prospered, and by 1908 they had secured trade deals in the United States, Canada and other Commonwealth states, although it is not known if they had dealings within Ireland.\nWhen his father died, Reginald was still only a lad of 14, attending Northampton Grammar School. It is not clear exactly when he joined the family business, but it is most likely that he spent much of the next decade working there before the war broke out. He spent the war years in active service, and according to his service numbers, he would have been a reservist in England before the war even began, so he would have been one of the first on the battlefield. He was a field driver for the Royal Field Artillery, a job that involved driving up to six horses as a time as they lugged artillery across the battlefield. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCsyd-FfGhk\nMeanwhile, the factory was contracted by the government to produce leather for the army. Reginald survived the war and rejoined the family business in 1919, gaining plenty more experience, before eyeing up the emerging opportunities in the neighbouring Irish Free State. It is well worth noting that while Dickens Leather in Dungarvan had over 100 men working, there were only about 50 men on the floor in Northampton, before mechaninisation in the 1950s reduced the need for so many manual workers. This figure also gives us some context for how large the Dungarvan operation actually was. Furthermore, in the scramble for business contracts in the puritanical – or family-oriented – Irish Free State, Dickens Bros’ habit of employing only men was seen by the Irish ministry as a positive.\nDickens Leather Bros, at it became known in the 1920s, would stay operational, and in the family, until 2019, under the watch of Reginald’s nephew Brian (1938-2025). After it closed, he claimed the business was the longest running finished leather manufacturing business in Northampton, and perhaps the oldest in the UK.",

    "text": "The treemap displays the number of shares for each shareholder. Reginald Dickens owned half of the 6000 shares, while directors had at least 500. Austie Casey had 1000.\n\n\nThe following is taken from an initial analysis of the ledger book, and lots of details need to be clarified on further inspection.\n\nNominal capital of £40000, £24000 was issues\n\n50% preferential\n50% ordinary\n\n\nOne of the most important documents to survive from Dickens Leather is the Share Ledger which keeps track of the 12000 ordinary shares issued.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no record of the preferential shares sold and these may have have attracted a larger number of small investors who were new to the game, riding the feel-good wave of the freshly ambitious state.\n\nMost importantly, we see that Reginald Dickens owned exactly half of the shares (numbered 1-6000) and this would have been the most he was allowed to own, in accordance with the new laws, as he was not a citizen of Ireland. The directors come next, with 1000 shares reserved for Kennedy O’Brien (10001-11000) and Austie Casey (11001-12000).\n\nThe other local director, Joe Molony had just 500, and his pile (7814-8313) is plucked from the middle, rather than being reserved. Yet is clear from the numbers that his were bought alongside those of the family business, A Moloney and Sons Ltd (7694-7813).\nWhat is most interesting about the shares of Kennedy O’Brien and Austie Casey is that each of them had a chunk of shares redistributed not long after the initial shares were sold. Within a year of issue, O’Brien had his allotment split and given to a Max Davis, a Dublin-based businessman whose profession is listed as “Company Director”.\n\nIt may be the case the O’Brien had to borrow the money off Davis in order to satisfy the expectations attached to being a director and chairman.\nOver the next decade, O’Brien bought amassed further 1000 (ish - count) shares, bringing his total count back up to 1500. This suggests that O’Brien was reinvesting the profits of his other businesses into Dickens Leather, even as his day-to-day influence receded into the background (check).\n\nAs for Austie Casey, 123 of his allotment were given to his older brother Richard, within a couple of months, and this may well be evidence of another loan. While locals may have been willing to have (effectively) made small loans to their local doctor, the more worldly priest must have wanted a longer-term cut of the proceeeds, and over the next two decades, Richard would amass another 675 shares, making him one of the biggest shareholders. Where exactly he got this money is yet to be determined.\nBeyond the directors, shares were split among a combination of Dungarvan businessmen and a smattering of professionals from around the country. Fortunately, the shareholders’ professions are listed, along with their addresses, so we can see who from Dungarvan and who was from further afield.\nAmong the Dungarvan people we have:\n\nA. Molony and Sons 130, a local business who had an award-winning bakery and fingers in several other local pies, including the Urban district council and the FF cumainn. In 1932, his bread won a Silver medal at the London Baking and Trade Exhibition.\nK Williams Co Ltd (100)\nMiss Margaret Anne Phelan (100)\nPierce Casey (75)\n\nQuestion: did individual locals have preferential shares or did Austie keep them all for himself?\n\nand where they live. Reginald Dickens (from England, in forest green) owned 6000 of the 12000 ordinary shares. Dungarvan people (purple), including the directors Michael Casey and Joe Molony, accounted for c.3500 of the shares, and the remainder were held in Dublin (lime green)* or elsewhere.",
