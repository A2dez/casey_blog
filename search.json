    "text": "Splendid new leather factory\n\nMonday, May 3, 1937\n\nIrish Press reports the next day\nDungarvan Observer on the Saturday\nIn production for some 12 months\nMachinery worth £13000\n\n\nOpening:\n\nIreland in 1937 was a land filled with the hope of coming prosperity.\n\nWhile it was most certainly a repressive theocracy, it was also a state that had begun building towards self-sufficiency through the sudden emergence of an industrial sector thanks in part to the large tariffs that had recently been placed on imported goods.\n\n\n\nThe opening of Dickens Leather Factory, on Monday, 3 September, 1937 was a special day in the town’s history and it gives us the ideal opportunity to get introduced to the characters in the story and to understand who was who when the factory opened. Officially opened, that is, because the factory was already up and running for fully twelve months (GET DATES) and, given the circumstances, that was the hard part done, as we shall see.\nThe ceremony began with the arrival of Minister Sean Lemass, who was yet again made Minister of Industry and Commerce in the new Dáil of July 1937, where Fianna Fail rubberstamped their authority on the The Irish Free State, winning exactly 50% of seats, before reconstituting the state by the end of the year. Lemass had been most successful in his first ministerial term, opening up countless new factories around the state, including County Waterford’s other leather factory in the village of Portlaw.\nLemass alighted in Abbeyside, the village across the bridge from Dungarvan Town, and he we was met by a local priest and most of the directors of Dickens Leather. Fr T.B. Walsh was the Chairman of the Dungarvan Industrial Development Association, a group that included two local, Dr Michael Augustine Casey and Patrick J. Molony, the managing director of A. Molony and Sons (shipping?)This team had agitated hard to get the factory into Dungarvan and the factory in Portlaw proved to be a complementary stepping stone, in terms of both personnel and output. Portlaw’s produce was mostly based on hard cowhide leather, used in the soles of the shoes, whereas Dungarvan’s produce was mostly based on softer sheepskin leather, used for upper parts of the shoe and inner linings. Their leadership groups were also hugely overlapping. The Chairman of Dickens Leather was Mr Kennedy O’Brien who was becoming something leather baron across Ireland. He was CHAIR? of Portlaw, and his core business was as leather merchant in Dublin City. And the Managing Director was the eponymous Reginald Dickens from England, and his family’s core business was in Northampton, the most famous city in the world for leather and shoe production. Dungarvan and Portlaw, for him, were side ventures from his main business, run by Reginald and his brothers, and by their father before them since 1897.\nThe town was ready for its big day and once the men of influence had assembled, the triumphal procession could begin to slither through the freshly decorated streets, to the roars of the crowd, as cheer after cheer rent the air. Varicoloured bunting festooned the main streets and large banners welcomed the Minister to the town. The local Gardaí formed a bodyguard for Lemass and the parade was fronted by the Waterford Brass and Reed band playing familiar airs, many with a nationalistic bent, for the day was an expression of both national and local pride. The crowd filed in behind them like mass-goers forming a queue for communion and, on arrival at Quay Street, they were met by the hundred-plus men who worked in the factory nearby, at The Lookout, looking out at the wide expanse of Dungarvan Bay.\nA temporary stand was erected and Lemass was greeted by Kennedy O’Brien in his capacity of Chairman of Dickens Leather. Meanwhile, the band played the National Anthem while the deep crowds looked on. Several welcoming addresses were made. First up were The Urban District Council and then Father Walsh himself. Not one, but two local Fianna Fail groups gave an address: the Padraig Pearse Cumann and the Cathal Brugha Cumannn and, finally, an unidentified of the factory’s workforce said some words, with no name given by any of the newspaper reports.\nThe last public address was made by Lemass himself. He thanked and congratulated the above-mentioned men of power, the workers and his Fianna Fail colleagues in the Cumainn, but also spoke the crowd themselves, noting the importance of the factory in generating employment and prosperity to the locality.\nAfterwards, O’Brien presented Lemass with a symbolic gold key to the factory, and, with the church and local government and the politicians having all had their say, and with the band playing Faith of Fathers, it was time for the factory to be blessed solemnly by His Lordship, The Most Reverand Doctor Jeremiah Kinane, Bishop of Waterford and Lismore, ably assisted by the Parish Priest, The Very Reverand T. Canon O’Brien, and his curate, the above-mentioned Reverand TB Walsh.\nAfterwards, Dickens gave the Bishop and Minister a guided tour of inspection of the factory\n\nThe factory was left open for the local hoards to investigate and one wonders how well supervised the machines were with children running round.\nLater in the day, Lemass would point out how great it was that the factory was a truly local venture – and it certainly was for the staff employed in the factory. But the reality is that the directors were a mix of locals (Austie Casey and Joe Molony) with bigger fish.\nIn July 1937, Fianna Fail had yet again won the general election, and were continuing their policy of applying huge tariffs on imported goods, a policy which facilitated the growth of an unprecendented number of mid-sized factories around the state. Sean Lemass was again the Minister of Industry and Commerce, a position he would hold between 1932 and 1959 for for sixteen intermittent years.\n\nThe town\n\nwas en fete for the occasion\nflags and bunting on all the prinicipal streets\n\ncolourful and festive appearance\nfestooned with bunting and schools beating inscriptions of ‘Welcome to the factory’\n\nMusic\n\nwaterford brass and reed band\n\nplayhing national and popular airs\n\n\n\nArrival Order\n\nLemass met at Abbeyside Bridge by\n\nmet by Rev T Walsh, CC, Chairman of Dungarvan Industrial Development Association, and:\n\nthe directors\nmembers of the urban council\nlarge gathering of the general public\n\n\nA bodyguard of honour of the civic guards\n\nChief Superintendant E.

The minister has come here to officially open our factory, and his Lordship the Bishop of Waterford has come to impart God’s blessing upon our industry. On your behalf and on that of the people of Dungarvan, I wish to thank those distinguished gentlemen”\n“Hear, hear”\n“The establishment in Dungarvan of the important factory is due mainly to the efforts made by the members of the Dungarvan Industrial Devopment Association, working unselfishly in the interests of their native town and of the townspeople. In referreint to the DIDC, I wish to make special reference to the work of the Chairman, Rev Father (T B) Walsh and to the members of the committee, including Dr Michael Casey and PJ Molony. These gentlemen and other members of the committee, to my knowlege, spent many weary months in an effort to secure for the town a suitable industry that would provide much neeede employment. I think everyboyd will agree that their efforts have been successful.\n[Speaking from a life of experience, he wrote] The industry is a highly technical one, there is a very large market available within the Irish Free State for its products, [The first and most difficult period of the company’s history has now passed] and employment is given to over 100 male workers to whom good wages are paid.\nThe sales of the company in recent months were higher than even the most optimistic of them had expected when it started and they were still increasing.\nThe establishment of the indusry had been brought about as a result of the industrial policy of the government which aimed at making the country self-sufficient, and, ny creating industries for the manufacture of the country’s requirements, giving much-needed employment.\n\n[include the wage bill here – maybe £300 per week, to be converted to modern money for comparison, but ideally with a list of what that could buy\n\nI should like to express appreciation to those who invested the necessary capital to permit this industry to be started, said Mr O’Brien. I can assue them that it is now firmly establised, that the company’s prospects are, in my opinion, most favourable, and that their interestes will be looked after, to the best of our ability, by me and my co-directors.\nA tribute must be paid to the employees. The managing director has told me that they have adapted themselves very quickly to the training facilities offered to them, and have worked willingly and loyally in the interests of the company.\nThe establishment of this industry has been brought about as a result of the industrial policy of the Government, which has as its object the making of this country self-sufficient, and by the creation of industries for the manufacture of the rquirements of the country, giving much-needed employment. From what I have already told you, I think you will agree that this object has been achieved so far as the factory in Dungarvan is concerned.\n\nIP: @while there might be a feeling of disappointment that a large part of the industrial field was still untilled, very few people were disposed to think that the industrial enterprises set going since the present government took office would ever fall is adequately supported byt heir own opein. And that support, in my opinion, is likely to be forthcoming in ever-increasing measure in the future”\n\nAs an example of what has been achieved in the leather industry, said Mr O’Brien, I am asking th Minister to accept a pair of slippers. The upper leather of these slippers has been manufactured from native Irish sheepskin tanned in our factory here in Dungaravan; the sole and insold leather from native cow-hide tanned in the neighbouring factory in Portlaw; the lasts on which they have been manufactured were made in the recently established factory in Newbridge [lasts are a wooden form on which the leather upper of a shoe is shaped.], and the manufacture of the slippers themselvers was carried out by the well-known and old-establihsed firm of boot and show manufacturers of Messrs Hearne and Cahill, Waterford. The slippers are presented not for their intrinsic valude as a memento of the work done in the establishment and development of Irish industries by the Minister for Industry and commerce.\nApplause\n\nFind out the yeas in which each of these factories was established\n\nJust another day at the office for Lemass\nThis is where the cartoon ought to go\nReplying to the toast, Mr Lemass said thay they had gathered from the newspaper reports that he frequeently had occasion to attend functions like that, and for one holding the position fo Minister for Industry and Commerce it was always a pleasure to be present at such function, but the pleasure was not entirely an unmixed one, because as time passed it became increasingly difficult to say something original. This was the first occasion he was able to visit Dungarvan for a number of years, and he was very glad that the occasion was one associated with the establishment of an industry in the town, [with characteristic vision, he continued] an industry that would not merely be of considerable benefit to the town at present, but offers considerable prospects of development for the future, enabling it to extend its roll of its employees, enlarge the sum which is distributed in weekly wages, and thus extending the trade of the town, and help to add to its presperity, and promote the general business activities of the town.\nIf there is one reason more than another why I am please to be associated with this enterprise, he said, is because in the best and truest sense of the term this is a local enterprise.\n\nOf course there was a swathe of outsiders with their fingers in this local pie (Dickens, O’Brien, Crowley)\n\n\nMr Lemass continued that the history of the establishment of this factory in Dungarvan would be a source of benefit to the citizens of other towns in the Free State, in which factories of a similar nature had not yet been set up, and where the volume of demand for such a factory had grown in persistence. [e.g. Carrick-on-Suir for leather, but plenty more other factories]. He was glad that a tribute had been paid to the local committee because the factory would not have been established at all only for their efforts.\n\nwhose efforts led to the formation of a company financed without outsdie assistance or the usual underwriting facilities.\n\n\nAt some stage a factory such as this would have been set up in the country, but not necessarily by the compnay which was no operating here, and certainly not in Dungarvan, were it not for the work of the local committee, of which he had personal evidence a long time ago. [Walsh, Casey, Molony et al] They set out to establish an industry here and very quickly established contact with teh Department and he was glad that they were able to assiste them. Again, the company was formed and finance without outside assistance, underwriting facilities or any other financial help, as was due not alone to the promoters but to the good citizenship of the people of Dungaravvan and the locality,\n\nit was an investment that showed not only their belief in the industrial future of this countr, but also their confidence in the ability of their own townmen to make good in industrial work.\n\nand he did not think that at any time they would have reaon to regret what they had done and the investment they had made. This industry, like all new industries, had to overcome difficulties, had (?)not been surmounted and the company was progressing very satisfactorily indeed.\nDamn the begrudgers\nSpeaking on the industrial development of the country, the Minister said that what had been said, written and through about the industrial future of this country in past years, was nonsense and was used by those who had vested interests in maintaining the old position. When the opportunity was given for developing the industrial position of the country that opportunity was availed of not by the people of one party or one class, but was availed of by a large numer of people in the country, many of whom differed fundamentally in matters of political policy in other directions.\n“In these days of economic stress”, said Mr Lemass, “We are all naturally perturbed at the continued existence of unemployment on a wide scale, and emigration, which stopped for a short time, and is now resumed”\n\nNeed to check stats on that. The issue being that there were no jobs abroad now to emigrate to\nNo one emigrated to America\n\nHe was sure that most thinking people realised that the problem of unemployment and the problem of emigration were both the same, and the social evils to which they gave rise could not be terminated without the greatest degree of industrial development that circumstances would permit.\n“Irrespective of the opintions we might hold on a wide variety of things,” said Mr Lemass, “there is no substantion section of our people who do not know the urgency of industrial development so that people might be given more employment and a wider variety of employment”\nThe minister continued by saying that if they could secure the maximum of industrial development, and secure at the same time that needs of the people in housing were adequately catered for, they could usefully occupy the labour of every unemployed man amongst them.\nConcluding, the Minister said that they had a number of economoic problems for soluation and a very large number of of social evils to terminate. He trusted that the succes which had met the efforts of the local committed in Dungaravan, which resulted in giving employment to more than one hundred men in the town who would otherwise be idle or forced to emigrate, would encourage other committees in the country to make a special effort to solve their own problems, and he could assure them that if they had any practical plans they could rely on the cooperation of not merely the Dept of INdustry and Commerce, but of every Government department\nApplause\nOther Toasts\nProposing the toast of ‘The Company’, Rev Fr Walsh, BA, CC, Dungarvan said that the products of the factory had entered most of the homes of this country. [(t was a matter of nationwide significance. The minister had spoken very highly of them, and it was very kind of him. The local Industrical Development Committe had done as far as it could its best. That day they had seen a body of men at the factory engaged in manufacture, with the knowledge that they were not distributing foreing goods, but engaged in the noble work of making goods for consumption by the Irish people. The best bulwark the clergy have against Communism, or any other ism”, said Father Walsh, “the best guarantee of fidelity [Faith and Fatherland] we have is the contented working man.”\n\nHe concluded by saying that they were deeply indebted to Mr Dickens, who had come there to teach them about the business to which he had given a lifetime.\n\nSupporting the toast, Mr EA Ryan, State Solicitor, said they had taken part in what he considered to be a very momentous event that day. They were there representing as they did a part of a living generation of Irishmen and women and have taken ……. what has been one of the most extraordinary political and economic revoluations in the history of the world, and developing towards what he hoped would be the complete and absolute political and economic freedom of this country. That might sound extraordinary to some people, but it was a natural expression of thought on his part. Referring to the fishing industry, he said that the town was once a great fishing town, and he could remember in his boyhood days seeing fifty or sixty crafts at the quays, and he hoped that in the near future something would again be done for that industry. [ there are numerous young men who could fin employment int he fishing industry and he hoped that somethign would be done for them]\nMR R Dickens, replying to the toast, said that he had taken on a job of work, and he intended to see it through. He paid tribute to the wonderful cooperation he had received from the people of Dungarvan. [he was grateful for the consideration which he had receieved from the MinistRY of Industry and Commerce]\nThe toast of “Our Guests” was proposed by Dr M Casey, who, in doing so, said that he wnated to see more people employed in the town, and he wanted to see Dungarvan and the whole of the county prosperous. [the opening of the factory was a work for the betterment ofthe people of the country and was a memorable event int he history of the borough of Dungarvan].\nVery Reverand Canon O’Brien, supporting the toast, said that the prosperity of the town was undoubtedly growing. [the happiest relations existed between the men employed and the management of the factory] (a situation that wsa not to last)\nMrs Redmond, TD, replying to the toast, said that Dungarvan and Waterford as a whole had suffered much in recent years, and, therefore, it was very good to see this industry established. Money and expense had not been thought about in establishing the industry, and she could see no reason why the factory should not have a prosperous future. [she hoped that the new industry would eb the forerunner of others to come in Dungarvan] how many women TDs were there\nMr PJ LIttle, TD, also replied to the toast, the proceedings closed with the singing of the National Anthem by all present.\n\n\n\n\nAmongst those present at the opening ceremony and luncheon were:\nSpeakers in Bold:\nItalics means mentioned by the Irish press\nHow many women?\nMessrs.

    "text": "Plots\n\nmap of tanneries & footwear factories in Ireland\nbubbleplot showing the number of employees in each factory over time (GET THE DATA)\n\nTimeline for chapter\n\n1820-1930: Decline\n1930s Resurrection (THIS OVERLAPS WITH KENNEDY O’BRIEN PROFILE)\n\nLocation (ALSO OVERLAPS WITH KOB)\n\n1940s variation? (MISSING)\n1950s Peak and slow decline (MISSING)\n\n1830s Peak\nThe emergence of a leather industry in 1930s Ireland was akin to a resurrection from a long and painful death. The previous hundred years had seen a steady decline of a once-flourishing native industry. The peak was in the 1820s and ’30s around the time that livestock began to be exported en masse to Britain, thanks to improvements in sea communications, and thus there fewer and fewer hides available for tanning. In 1837 there were 46 tanneries in the city of Cork alone, tanning over 2000 hides per week. and employing 625 people, which is more people than were employed across the twenty-six counties at the height of the resurrection in the 1950s. To grasp the proliferation of the industry in comparison, it may be instructive to compare it to sports clubs in the modern day. Currently, there are 225 GAA clubs in the county of Cork alone, and over 1600 hundred on the island, whereas there are just 109 rugby clubs on the island, many of them clustered in a few hubs. And just as almost every parish nowadays has its own GAA club, every town and village in pre-famine Ireland would have had a tanyard, alongside at least one person making shoes and another repairing them.\nDecline\nBy 1852, after The Great Hunger had destroyed the nation, there were still 26 tanneries in Cork City, although few of them were operating full-time as demand for leather had understandably dropped and credit was scarce so the businesses couldn’t get back on their feet. By 1902, there were just three tanneries in Cork and just 18 across the entire island of Ireland. In 1923, when a Free State report was commissioned, there were just five. The only large-scale operation was Callaghans in Limerick City, tanning 200 hides per week, and small operation in Thomastown, Clonmel, Ballitore and New Ross, tanning just 100 hiders per week between them. In total, these tanneries were supplying on one twentieth of the state’s demand for leather, so the other 95% had to be imported. Even so, New Ross would close down the following year.\nThe reasons for the decline of the leather industry thus provide us with something of a microcosm of the problems that Ireland faced during the tragic century between the 1820s and 1920s. A tannery needs two things more than anything else: animal skins and dyes for tanning, and both of these were being purged from the country. Livestock were shipped to Britain in ever-increasing numbers and with them vanished the jobs associated with processing the animals, such as butchering the flesh and tanning the skins. Meanwhile, dyes taken from oak bark were becoming harder to source due to deforestation, although by our time of interest, different dyes were being used. A completely different, and preventable problem, was in how duties were levied on tanners. In England, tanners paid duty on every hide processed whereas in Ireland they paid duty on the pits used for processing them, so too many hides would be processed in the one pit, resulting in lower quality leather being made throughout Ireland, and thus greater demand for leather imported from across the pond. Finally, there was little hope of any Irish tanneries exporting leather to Britain, seeing as Britain imposed a 60% tariff on Irish leather but there was only a 10% tariff in the opposite direction.\nShoots of growth\nBetween 1922 and 1932, there was no improvement in the leather industry, although there was a little growth in the footwear industry and these helped paved the way for native leather production which could then be used as a raw material for footwear. In 1924, small tariffs of 15% were introduced on footwear sales in Ireland, but British manufacturers were mostly efficient enough to outprice the emerging batch of Irish producers. However, UK-based businesses began to arrive in The Free State with Edward Donaghy bringing his entire business over the border to Dundalk and, in 1928, John Halliday of Leeds also set up a factory in Dundalk. Later, County Louth would become something of a hub for the Irish footwear industry. The same year, the Irish Tanners Foundation decided that they also wanted some support, so they lodged a case with the newly-formed Tariff Commission, but all they got was a little support in putting tariffs\nThis of course changed with the arrival the Fianna Fail government in 1932\nLocation\nWhile the emerging footwear industry was clustered along the",

    "title": "4  Kennedy O’Brien and the Portlaw Tannery",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Kennedy O’Brien was one of the few bona fide leather men left in early Free State Ireland by which time the tanning industry had dwindled almost entirely out of existence. Yet over the next few decades he helped to build up the industry more than any other person on the ground and his story is an interesting contrast to his colleague-to-be, Austie Casey, because O’Brien was focussed single-mindedly on leather and nothing else, plus he also lived longer to see out his ambitions.\nKennedy O’Brien grew up in Limerick, the son of pig buyer also called Kennedy O’Brien. Kennedy was a given name that went back for generations in that branch of the family and census records of 1911 show eleven men in Ireland of that name, possibly all them related as most of them were in the Limerick area, and only one lived improbably far away. There might have been even more Kennedy O’Briens, only the Catholic Church didn’t like children to be baptised with anything other than a saint’s name, although family lore claims that there was a cheeky way of twisting the church’s arm. Our Kennedy’s father simply told the Parish Priest that if he didn’t let his son be baptised with the preferred name, then the child would be brought round the corner and baptised a Protestant. This did the trick and thus the curious, heavy-duty, forename lived on.\nOur Kennedy O’Brien was aged 22 at the 1911 census, making him a full decade older than Austie. He was listed as an accountant but may have already begun working in O’Callaghan’s Tannery in Limerick City, the last surviving large-scale tannery on the island. He was head-hunted by the Managing Director, Michael O’Callaghan, who would serve as Mayor of Limerick before being murdered in 1921, likely by the Black and Tans or the RIC Auxiliaries.2 But O’Callaghan said he needed someone to help him estimate the number of hides needed in the factory – clearly a job suited to a man of numbers – but O’Brien already had a job lined up in Dublin and was due to begin a few months later. O’Callaghan said that the clever young man was free to leave when his other job was ready to start. O’Brien took the job and clearly found his place in the world as he spent the rest of his life selling and making leather, as well as spawning a handful of sons who followed him into the trade.\nHaving established himself within the Limerick tannery buildings, and built the trust of his boss, O’Brien was given a car and sent out to sell O’Callaghan’s leather to the shoemakers and shoe repair shops of Ireland – all thirty-two counties, as partition was yet to be implemented. This constant movement suited his restless nature and it also gave him a great appreciation of the needs of the Irish people, their need for more employment, and the country’s need for a native tanning industry, rather than importing almost all of its leather from Britain, much of it made from the hides of exported Irish livestock.\nIn 1927, O’Brien set up his own business as a wholesale leather merchant, on 27 North Frederick St in Dublin City, and that building would become the centre of operations for his ever-expanding leather empire. It must have been around this time that he became friendly with Sean Lemass3 who became known for cavorting with city businessmen, playing golf by day or poker at night. Yet cronyism aside, there is unlikely to have been anyone better suited than O’Brien to the task of planning a native tanning industry, between his years of experience, his knowledge of the entire country from his time on the road, and his deep zeal for employment creation. Thus having the Dublin man’s ear would prove most invaluable once the Fianna Fail government took control of the country in 1932 and set out their twin policies of protectionism and decentralization, leading to the establishment of so many factories around the towns of Ireland, big and small. By the mid 1930s, O’Brien’s Dublin business was firmly established, so he would have the time and energy to throw into the Portlaw venture.\nWhy Portlaw?\nThe choice of a settlement as small as Portlaw might seem odd for such a large operation, but DJ Dwyer, in his 1962 study of the Irish Tanning industry, considers it something of a prototypical choice for a tannery. One requirement was easy access to a port (Waterford) as tanning agents had to be imported from around the globe. Secondly, tanneries are better suited to a rural location as the smell and waste are so obnoxious. And finally, there needs to be a lot of water available, coming in and going out of the factory. Water is brought in for the tanning itself and, however unsatisfactory it might be to modern sensibilities, a body of water was needed to dump the untreated waste. Dickens Leather in Dungarvan, located where the Colligan River meets the sea, could take water from the river and dump it into the sea afterwards. The tannery in Gorey had to have a huge waste pipe built, running several miles to the sea, suggesting that politics played a greater role than geography in choosing the town. The Portlaw tannery sat on a bend on the River Clodiagh, a tributary of the River Suir, again providing water on both sides. The site had previously been used for a cotton mill in the nineteenth century, run by a Quaker family. Indeed the town was purpose-built for its workers and, when the tannery finally opened, a former employee of the mill, aged 94, showed up and demanded to be given a job in his old haunt.\nIt turns out that Lemass was, in the end, somewhat regretful at having chosen Portlaw as the site of the first Irish tannery. The town, or perhaps village, was so small that the meal for the opening ceremony in 1935 had to be cooked in Waterford and transported to Portlaw. Fianna Fail might have gained more political traction by putting it into a town with a much larger population – such as Dungarvan – where the staff’s wages could be recirculated more easily, bringing bonhomie to a wider array of voters. Lemass’s choice of Portlaw was informed by government officials who underestimated the coming demand for leather as the state sought self-sufficiency. It quickly became clear that their estimate of 225,000 hides per annum was too low and so was a second estimate of 300,000 hides, made by Vincent Crowley, a Dublin-based solicitor who became Chairman of Irish Tanners and also the accountant for Dickens Leather.\nPersonnel\nWhile the workers in Irish Tanners, Portlaw were local, the management group most certainly weren’t. Kennedy O’Brien became a director and general manager, running the day-to-day operations while his Dublin business ticked over. Crowley was chairman and the secretary was his employee, Dr Jeremiah Dempsey, another city-based professional with his finger in the provincial pie. Despite the name of the tannery, it was actually British-owned and Mary Daly notes this it was registered to the tariff-jumping “British entrepreneur who already owned Western Tanning of Bristol and Redvales Ltd. of Bury.” Presumably, this was HG Barlow, the Managing Director of Irish Tanners, Portlaw’s equivalent of Reginald Dickens who himself was also present at the opening ceremony, along with Dr Austie Casey and many other prominent men of County Waterford.\nIn retrospect, it makes sense to view Portlaw and Dungarvan as complementary businesses, run by an overlapping group of people, especially in the beginning. They were not in direct competition because Portlaw focussed on hard leather soles for shoes, taken from tougher cowhides, whereas Dungarvan would focus on soft leathers taken from sheepskins. We might also think of the Portlaw and Dungarvan tanneries as a three-way compromise between three societal forces. The provincial townspeople did the actual work, capital and industry expertise came from British entrepreneurs (but not the British state), while those based in Dublin functioned as intermediaries between the two.\nHowever, a new law (The Control of Manufacturers Acts 1932-4) introduced by Fianna Fail required that the new industries not have majority control from a foreign company. Irish Tanners was in part funded by the Irish Credit Company, represented at the opening ceremony by its chairman, J.P. Colbert.4 The ICC was formed in 1933 in an effort to fund the new industries popping up around the country, and it is not much of a jump to imagine that the Dungarvan Tannery, with its complementary output, may have been envisioned as being a second branch of Irish Tanners. However, the ICC did not fund Dungarvan – perhaps it ran out of cash – so Irish capital had to be found from somewhere. We shall see in the next chapter that Reginald Dickens owned exactly half of the shares in Dickens Leather, and no capital came from the state. Thus the Irish interest had to be filled by someone, and Austie Casey and Joe Moloney stepped up to the\nManaging Portlaw remained O’Brien’s primary focus, and by 1957 it was said to be the sixth largest tannery in the world, and managed by his son Bartholemew. His sons became ever more involved in the family business, and Kennedy’s urge to create employment and wealth for his family, saw him set up something of a corridor of his own tanneries stretching between Dublin and Waterford. The first of these was in Gorey (1936) and later in Milford, Co Carlow, Rathangan, Co Kildare and Carnew, Co Wicklow. Meanwhile, his operations in Dublin continued to grow. He had a team of ladies on one floor cutting upper leathers for the shoe repairmen of Dublin and another team producing metal parts for working boots, parts which previously had to be imported from England.\nOne final story should illustrate the continued importance of Kennedy O’Brien to the Irish leather industry, and its ultimate demise in the latter part of the twentieth century. Among his many ventures, O’Brien, along with his namesake son, began producing football boots and running shoes, under the brand name Kayobee, taken from their initials. Kayobee shoes were worn in 1956 by Ronny Delany when he won an Olympic Gold medal in the 1500m, Ireland’s first gold medal since 1932, and the first to be televised. The 1950s would turn out to be the high point of the Irish leather industry, before plastics began to be used, and protectionist policies were relaxed, by Lemass himself. Meanwhile, Kayobee shoes, like all regional brands, would be ousted by some of the most iconic brands in the world, and the Irish tanneries slowly faded into oblivion. Our Kennedy O’Brien died in 1959 and his business was liquidated in 1972. The Portlaw tannery, having let go of its staff over several phases, finally closed in 1985 and the derelict factory was finally sold in 2024.",

His father seems to have been sympathetic and his brother is known to have been actively involved as a gun runner during the revolutionary years. Their father, Kennedy Sr, bought and sold pigs in Limerick, and it became Bart’s job to walk around with a cart and amass pig swill from the local hotels. This noxious task proved to be the ideal cover for transporting guns because they could be wrapped and placed beneath the swill. And if he was stopped by the police of the auxiliaries, none of them would swirl their hand through the filthy pit of used food. And while this method of transportation befuddled the authorities for a time, word must have leaked out because Bart was tipped off that they were on his case, so he fled to New York where he got a job with the Pinkerton Detective agency and, thanks to his free transport pass, he resumed his gun-running acitivities, only at the other end of the chain.↩︎\nColbert, John Patrick | Dictionary of Irish Biography↩︎",
