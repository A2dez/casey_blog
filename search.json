    "text": "Lourdes\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1913, Casey also seems to have been part of very large group of Irish pilgrims to Lourdes: 3000 in total, including 300 priests and another 200 with a religious affiliation, according to the newspaper clippings above, one in French and one in English, and both of which Casey had upscaled into a lantern slide. This pèlerinage seems to have been one of the events of the year for the Lourdais and it would have been quite the journey for the pilgrims on the boat and train. It would no doubt have been quite the badge of honour in New York too. Even today my parents are very proud of their visit to the miraculous site – although they did cycle there (and back) from Paris during their 1990s cycling-getaway heyday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are plenty of photos taken in Lourdes do but I never got to see them. I had it in my head Casey went later but perhaps he went several times, as has since become common. I used to live beside two spinster sisters, just off Meath St, and they had then been volunteering on trips to Lourdes for 25 uninterrupted years, and their living room contained a shrine full of tat. I must drop in some time, armed with a bottle of their beloved vodka, and excavate a few stories from them.\n\nBack in The Free State\n\n\n\nThis slide shows General Richard Mulcahy hoisting the flag of Irish Free State in 1922\n\n\nCasey returned to Ireland in the summer of 1920 and moved to Bray soon after, before finally joining hte Defence Forces as chaplain in 1924. Before seeing the collection, I hadn’t realised that he continued to give projected talks after his return to Ireland but the age of the slides indicate that he must have. There are several slides dating from Casey’s time back in the Auld Sod, and the ones I saw relate to the newly formed Free State in the early 1920s. One shows General Richard Mulcahy hoisting the Irish flag in 1922 and one shows an aerial view of a damaged Four Courts, bombed and burnt during the Civil War. Another shows troops marching to Dolphin’s Barn Barracks from DMP Barracks (which is now the public library in an oddly vacant part of Inchicore). Another aerial shot shows President Cosgrave returning to Monkstown from a League of Nations meeting in 1923, being greeted by crowds who were clearly delighted to see the new state being recognised among the nations of the world. Casey’s scrapbook contains a flyer from April 1922 where he spoke to the Catholic Young Men’s Society on Buckingham St (on the town side of Phibsborough), but the above slides were mostly taken after that.\n\n\n\nCasey spoke to the CYM society in Dublin in 1922, but must have continued beyond this, judging by the date of the slides.\n\n\n\n\nThe Archivists’ Records\n\n\n\nCatalogue details of the Fr Casey collection\n\n\nAbove is the full catalogue record of the collection, with information about what is in the collection, the number of photos, slides and negatives, their condition, and the subject matter. If I can get back in with John Harte, there will be plenty more to sift through.\n\n\nYet more Caseys\nFinally, I should note that, while I was the first member of the public to view the collection, I wasn’t the first to request to view it. It turns out that a genealogist called Paul O’Donnell was in touch with Nora and her colleague Barbara but Covid interrupted his efforts to view it and then, shurlook, you know yourself. So while I was in on site, Barbara found his email, contacted him with my details, and by the end of the day we had a 40 minute phone conversation about the Casey family. It turns out that O’Donnell is married to a Casey from Grawn – the crowd who moved in there after it was sold – and he has done quite a bit of work on the wider family, although his brain is fried by the incessant recurrence of people with the same name (Richard, Pierce, Michael, etc). I will write about that conversation soon, or perhaps after I trek Co Galway to find out more from him."

This Casey – who is no relation to our subject – must have been quite the role model for our Richard. He was a Gaelgeoir, musician, GAA man, and temperance activist, which I suspect Fr Richard was too. Fr William was most active in the Land League, for which he gained huge local support, and so was Fr Richard’s uncle – another Fr Richard J Casey – to whom I shall one day return. There are no slides related to the Fenian Uprising of 1867, even though its veteran John Devoy had become the leading Republican in New York by the time of Casey’s lectures. This may be because the Fenians tried to keep a low profile and used codenames for their gatherings.\n\n\n\nThe young priest spoke in 1919 to the Gaelic Society of New York about “The Irish Brigade”\n\n\nOne such name was The Gaelic Society, and by January 1919, Casey was presenting at one of their céilidhthe, a combination that shows how revolutionary fervour could be drummed up amidst a cultural event, and a reminder that the Irish cultural revolution really holds primacy over the political revolution.\nIt is not clear how many talks Casey gave but we have newspaper clippings of several lectures between 1917 and 1919. I can’t yet work out exactly when the talks became heavily politicised, but in 1916 there were reports of him giving ‘Lenten Sermons’ about the religiosity of Irish faithful back home. Yet by 1917, The Gaelic American reports that ”\n\"[Casey] took occasion at every appropriate time, to demonstrate alleged pernicious results of English misrule in the country.\"\nClearly, the audience were on the same page as:\nThe photographs of Easter Week, 1916, were wildly applauded. \n\n\n\nasdlfkj\n\n\nCasey’s lecture to The Gaelic Society was about ‘The Irish Brigade”, a term used to refer to each sub-unit of the Irish Republican Army, and in May 1919 he was performing at The Central Opera House for between 1200 and 1800 listeners. This venue was used for ’ethnic theatre’ and it occasionally showed films about Ireland.\n\n\n\n\nSt Boniface Holy Name Society\n\n\nIt’s important to note here that these events were not dull lectures, but an ‘illustration’ of Ireland ‘in picture, song and story’. Clearly, Casey was an experienced orator from his sermons, but he was a keen musician and collaborated above with Professor Patrick J McNamara who (need to confirm) ran the St Boniface Holy Name Society. The photo above shows their band – taken from a lantern slide – and, a couple of years after Casey returned home, McNamara wrote to him to lament that there were no more pupils entering the Feis Ceoil. In Casey’s time, his pupils won gold and silver medals. Clearly the band were an ideal segue between the talk and the céilidhe.\nThe music would have had the other function of rousing the audience’s political sentiments and encouraging them to donate. In the same month as Casey’s talk in the Central Opera House, there were reports of $19,000 being raised in New York for the Irish cause. No doubt that increased over time as about a quarter of a million would be raised in America for the First Dail Loan. Casey himself contributed to this which we know because his scrapbook contains receipts of the bonds he himself bought. But his role was not as a financial contributor, but as a trusted man of influence who could rouse others to donate their cash.\nIt was this skill that would prove influential years later when it was time for his younger brother Austie to raise money for the factory in Dungarvan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCol1\n\n\n\n\nCol2\n\n\n\n\nCol3\n\n\n\n\nCol4\n\n\n\n\nCol5\n\n\n\n\nCol6\n\n\n\n\nCol7\n\n\n\n\nCol8\n\n\n\n\nCol9\n\n\n\n\nCol10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 14\n\n\n\n\n1916\n\n\n\n\nYonkers Herald\n\n\n\n\nLenten Sermon\n\n\n\n\nimg_5750\n\n\n\n\nhonest to god sermon about ireland and their good faith etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 27\n\n\n\n\n1917\n\n\n\n\nThe Gaelic American\n\n\n\n\nFr Casey to deliver lecture on Ireland\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCouldnt admit all to Ireland lecture\n\n\n\n\nimg_5757\n\n\n\n\nSt Josephs Hall, Ashburton.

I must drop in some time, armed with a bottle of their beloved vodka, and excavate a few stories from them.\n\nBack in The Free State\n\n\n\nThis slide shows General Richard Mulcahy hoisting the flag of Irish Free State in 1922\n\n\nCasey returned to Ireland in the summer of 1920 and moved to Bray soon after, before finally joining hte Defence Forces as chaplain in 1924. Before seeing the collection, I hadn’t realised that he continued to give projected talks after his return to Ireland but the age of the slides indicate that he must have. There are several slides dating from Casey’s time back in the Auld Sod, and the ones I saw relate to the newly formed Free State in the early 1920s. One shows General Richard Mulcahy hoisting the Irish flag in 1922 and one shows an aerial view of a damaged Four Courts, bombed and burnt during the Civil War. Another shows troops marching to Dolphin’s Barn Barracks from DMP Barracks (which is now the public library in an oddly vacant part of Inchicore). Another aerial shot shows President Cosgrave returning to Monkstown from a League of Nations meeting in 1923, being greeted by crowds who were clearly delighted to see the new state being recognised among the nations of the world. Casey’s scrapbook contains a flyer from April 1922 where he spoke to the Catholic Young Men’s Society on Buckingham St (on the town side of Phibsborough), but the above slides were mostly taken after that.\n\n\n\nCasey spoke to the CYM society in Dublin in 1922, but must have continued beyond this, judging by the date of the slides.\n\n\n\n\nThe Archivists’ Records\n\n\n\nCatalogue details of the Fr Casey collection\n\n\nAbove is the full catalogue record of the collection, with information about what is in the collection, the number of photos, slides and negatives, their condition, and the subject matter. If I can get back in with John Harte, there will be plenty more to sift through.\n\n\nYet more Caseys\nFinally, I should note that, while I was the first member of the public to view the collection, I wasn’t the first to request to view it. It turns out that a genealogist called Paul O’Donnell was in touch with Nora and her colleague Barbara but Covid interrupted his efforts to view it and then, shurlook, you know yourself. So while I was in on site, Barbara found his email, contacted him with my details, and by the end of the day we had a 40 minute phone conversation about the Casey family. It turns out that O’Donnell is married to a Casey from Grawn – the crowd who moved in there after it was sold – and he has done quite a bit of work on the wider family, although his brain is fried by the incessant recurrence of people with the same name (Richard, Pierce, Michael, etc). I will write about that conversation soon, or perhaps after I trek Co Galway to find out more from him."

The best known resident during Casey’s time would have been the fictional James Joyce who, according the O’Brien’s post-modern novel, The Dalkey Archive, was alive and well in the and living out his days in the town as an assistant publican, also known as a curate, a pun which leaves the fictional Joyce doubling up as assistant to the local parish Priest, our very own Very Reverand Monsignor Richard J Casey.↩︎"
