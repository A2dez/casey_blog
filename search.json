The minister has come here to officially open our factory, and his Lordship the Bishop of Waterford has come to impart God’s blessing upon our industry. On your behalf and on that of the people of Dungarvan, I wish to thank those distinguished gentlemen”\n“Hear, hear”\n“The establishment in Dungarvan of the important factory is due mainly to the efforts made by the members of the Dungarvan Industrial Devopment Association, working unselfishly in the interests of their native town and of the townspeople. In referreint to the DIDC, I wish to make special reference to the work of the Chairman, Rev Father (T B) Walsh and to the members of the committee, including Dr Michael Casey and PJ Molony. [Patrick J Moloney Managing director of A. Moloney and Sons.]\nThese gentlemen and other members of the committee, to my knowlege, spent many weary months in an effort to secure for the town a suitable industry that would provide much neeede employment. I think everyboyd will agree that their efforts have been successful.\n[Speaking from a life of experience, he wrote] The industry is a highly technical one, there is a very large market available within the Irish Free State for its products, [The first and most difficult period of the company’s history had now passed] and employment is given to over 100 male workers to whom good wages are paid.\n\n[include the wage bill here – maybe £300 per week, to be converted to modern money for comparison, but ideally with a list of what that could buy\n\nI should like to express appreciation to those who invested the necessary capital to permit this industry to be started, said Mr O’Brien. I can assue them that it is now firmly establised, that the company’s prospects are, in my opinion, most favourable, and that their interestes will be looked after, to the best of our ability, by me and my co-directors.\nA tribute must be paid to the employees. The managing director has told me that they have adapted themselves very quickly to the training facilities offered to them, and have worked willingly and loyally in the interests of the company.\nThe establishment of this industry has been brought about as a result of the industrial policy of the Government, which has as its object the making of this country self-sufficient, and by the creation of industries for the manufacture of the rquirements of the country, giving much-needed employment. From what I have already told you, I think you will agree that this object has been achieved so far as the factory in Dungarvan is concerned.\n\nIP: @while there might be a feeling of disappointment that a large part of the industrial field was still untilled, very few people were disposed to think that the industrial enterprises set going since the present government took office would ever fall is adequately supported byt heir own opein. And that support, in my opinion, is likely to be forthcoming in ever-increasing measure in the future”\n\nAs an example of what has been achieved in the leather industry, said Mr O’Brien, I am asking th Minister to accept a pair of slippers. The upper leather of these slippers has been manufactured from native Irish sheepskin tanned in our factory here in Dungaravan; the sole and insold leather from native cow-hide tanned in the neighbouring factory in Portlaw; the lasts on which they have been manufactured were made in the recently established factory in Newbridge [lasts are a wooden form on which the leather upper of a shoe is shaped.], and the manufacture of the slippers themselvers was carried out by the well-known and old-establihsed firm of boot and show manufacturers of Messrs Hearne and Cahill, Waterford. The slippers are presented not for their intrinsic valude as a memento of the work done in the establishment and development of Irish industries by the Minister for Industry and commerce.\nApplause\n\nFind out the yeas in which each of these factories was established\n\nJust another day at the office for Lemass\nThis is where the cartoon ought to go\nReplying to the toast, Mr Lemass said thay they had gathered from the newspaper reports that he frequeently had occasion to attend functions like that, and for one holding the position fo Minister for Industry and Commerce it was always a pleasure to be present at such function, but the pleasure was not entirely an unmixed one, because as time passed it became increasingly difficult to say something original. This was the first occasion he was able to visit Dungarvan for a number of years, and he was very glad that the occasion was one associated with the establishment of an industry in the town, [with characteristic vision, he continued] an industry that would not merely be of considerable benefit to the town at present, but offers considerable prospects of development for the future, enabling it to extend its roll of its employees, enlarge the sum which is distributed in weekly wages, and thus extending the trade of the town, and help to add to its presperity, and promote the general business activities of the town.\nIf there is one reason more than another why I am please to be associated with this enterprise, he said, is because in the best and truest sense of the term this is a local enterprise.\n\nOf course there was a swathe of outsiders with their fingers in this local pie (Dickens, O’Brien, Crowley)\n\n\nMr Lemass continued that the history of the establishment of this factory in Dungarvan would be a source of benefit to the citizens of other towns in the Free State, in which factories of a similar nature had not yet been set up, and where the volume of demand for such a factory had grown in persistence. [e.g. Carrick-on-Suir for leather, but plenty more other factories]. He was glad that a tribute had been paid to the local committee because the factory would not have been established at all only for their efforts.\nAt some stage a factory such as this would have been set up in the country, but not necessarily by the compnay which was no operating here, and certainly not in Dungarvan, were it not for the work of the local committee, of which he had personal evidence a long time ago. [Walsh, Casey, Molony et al] They set out to establish an industry here and very quickly established contact with teh Department and he was glad that they were able to assiste them. Again, the company was formed and finance without outside assistance, underwriting facilities or any other financial help, as was due not alone to the promoters but to the good citizenship of the people of Dungaravvan and the locality, and he did not think that at any time they would have reaon to regret what they had done and the investment they had made. This industry, like all new industries, had to overcome difficulties, had (?)not been surmounted and the company was progressing very satisfactorily indeed.\nDamn the begrudgers\nSpeaking on the industrial development of the country, the Minister said that what had been said, written and through about the industrial future of this country in past years, was nonsense and was used by those who had vested interests in maintaining the old position. When the opportunity was given for developing the industrial position of the country that opportunity was availed of not by the people of one party or one class, but was availed of by a large numer of people in the country, many of whom differed fundamentally in matters of political policy in other directions.\n“In these days of economic stress”, said Mr Lemass, “We are all naturally perturbed at the continued existence of unemployment on a wide scale, and emigration, which stopped for a short time, and is now resumed”\n\nNeed to check stats on that. The issue being that there were no jobs abroad now to emigrate to\nNo one emigrated to America\n\nHe was sure that most thinking people realised that the problem of unemployment and the problem of emigration were both the same, and the social evils to which they gave rise could not be terminated without the greatest degree of industrial development that circumstances would permit.\n“Irrespective of the opintions we might hold on a wide variety of things,” said Mr Lemass, “there is no substantion section of our people who do not know the urgency of industrial development so that people might be given more employment and a wider variety of employment”\nThe minister continued by saying that if they could secure the maximum of industrial development, and secure at the same time that needs of the people in housing were adequately catered for, they could usefully occupy the labour of every unemployed man amongst them.\nConcluding, the Minister said that they had a number of economoic problems for soluation and a very large number of of social evils to terminate. He trusted that the succes which had met the efforts of the local committed in Dungaravan, which resulted in giving employment to more than one hundred men in the town who would otherwise be idle or forced to emigrate, would encourage other committees in the country to make a special effort to solve their own problems, and he could assure them that if they had any practical plans they could rely on the cooperation of not merely the Dept of INdustry and Commerce, but of every Government department\nApplause\nOther Toasts\nProposing the toast of ‘The Company’, Rev Fr Walsh, BA, CC, Dungarvan said that the products of the factory had entered most of the homes of this country. [(t was a matter of nationwide significance. The minister had spoken very highly of them, and it was very kind of him. The local Industrical Development Committe had done as far as it could its best. That day they had seen a body of men at the factory engaged in manufacture, with the knowledge that they were not distributing foreing goods, but engaged in the noble work of making goods for consumption by the Irish people. The best bulwark the clergy have against Communism, or any other ism”, said Father Walsh, “the best guarantee of fidelity we have is the contented working man.”\n\nHe concluded by saying that they were deeply indebted to Mr Dickens, who had come there to teach them about the business to which he had given a lifetime.\n\nSupporting the toast, Mr EA Ryan, State Solicitor, said they had taken part in what he considered to be a very momentous event that day. They were there representing as they did a part of a living generation of Irishmen and women and have taken ……. what has been one of the most extraordinary political and economic revoluations in the history of the world, and developing towards what he hoped would be the complete and absolute political and economic freedom of this country. That might sound extraordinary to some people, but it was a natural expression of thought on his part. Referring to the fishing industry, he said that the town was once a great fishing town, and he could remember in his boyhood days seeing fifty or sixty crafts at the quays, and he hoped that in the near future something would again be done for that industry. [ there are numerous young men who could fin employment int he fishing industry and he hoped that somethign would be done for them]\nMR R Dickens, replying to the toast, said that he had taken on a job of work, and he intended to see it through. He paid tribute to the wonderful cooperation he had received from the people of Dungarvan. [he was grateful for the consideration which he had receieved from the MinistRY of Industry and Commerce]\nThe toast of “Our Guests” was proposed by Dr M Casey, who, in doing so, said that he wnated to see more people employed in the town, and he wanted to see Dungarvan and the whole of the county prosperous. [the opening of the factory was a work for the betterment ofthe people of the country and was memorable event int he history of the borough of Dungarvan].\nVery Reverand Canon O’Brien, supporting the toast, said that the prosperity of the town was undoubtedly growing. [the happiest relations existed between the men employed and the management of the factory] (a situation that wsa not to last)\nMrs Redmond, TD, replying to the toast, said that Dungarvan and Waterford as a whole had suffered much in recent years, and, therefore, it was very good to see this industry established. Money and expense had not been thought about in establishing the industry, and she could see no reason why the factory should not have a prosperous future. [she hoped that the new industry would eb the forerunner of others to come in Dungarvan] how many women TDs were there\nMr PJ LIttle, TD, also replied to the toast, the proceedings closed with the singing of the National Anthem by all present.\n\n\n\n\nAmongst those present at the opening ceremony and luncheon were:\nSpeakers in Bold:\nItalics means mentioned by the Irish press\nHow many women?\nMessrs.

There might have been more men of the same name only the Catholic Church didn’t like children to be baptised anything other than a saint’s name, but family lore claims that Kennedy Senior - or possibly Kennedy Senior Senior, or possibly any of the men looking to have their child named Kennedy - threatened the priest that if the Catholic Church wouldn’t baptise the child with the selected name, then they would go round the corner and have the latest Kennedy baptised into the Church of Ireland.\n\nOur Kennedy seems was aged 22 at the 1911 Census and was listed as an accountant.\n\nAs a young man, he had passed some exams and was all set to move to Dublin in a few months’ time to pursue a workaday job in his chosen field. However, Young Kennedy was approached by the owner of O’Callaghan’s Tannery in Limerick, a man who doubled up as mayor of Limerick. This tannery was the last vestige of a once-thriving leather industry in Ireland which had been in decline ever since livestock began being exported safely to Britain in the 1820s.\n\nMr O’Callaghan told Kennedy that he had some immediate work for the lad and that he could head off to Dublin when the time came. The lad must have had a good head for numbers, and a reputation for it too, as he was tasked with calculating the number of hides O’Callaghan would be needing for various tasks. Kennedy O’Brien would stay with O’Callaghan for many years to come and he worked his way up the company.\n\n\nIn time he became a Travelling Salesman for O’Callaghan, a job then known as a ‘traveller’ and his role was to sell the tannery’s leather to the shoemakers and shoe repair shops around the entire island of Ireland as partition was yet to be implemented. This gave O’Brien a great appreciation of the needs of the people and how badly employment was needed around the country.\nit’s not clear exactly how KOB got to know Lemass, but he may well have been friendly with him before his leather business was set up\n\nGrandfather KOB was involved in the IRB,\nwhole lot of stables at the back of Fairgreen\nused to send around Michael Traynor with a donkey and cart\nAnd all the swill from the hotels would be picked up\nand they used to feed the\nTurns out that Bart was getting guns and moving them around the city of Limerick putting them into the swill\nand if they were held up with by the Auxiliaries or the police there was none of them going to put their hands down into the pig swill\nonce they figured it out, Bart was tipped off and he ended up in New York\nGot a job with the Pinkerton detective agency and in that job he could travel all over the United States [for] free.

After the American war of independance when protectionist tactics were introduced the Irish cotton industry declined and the factory and mill closed. Subsequently the Portlaw Spinning Co. took over the mill but the company had a short life span survive closing in 1904. My families involvement with Portlaw started when my grandfather Kennedy O’Brien set up Irish Leathers in 1920 taking over the factory buildings in Portlaw in 1932 and employing several hundred employees at the height of the tanning industry until the introdution of plastics into shoe making which heralded the downfall of the leather industry in Ireland and the company closed in 1980.\n\nMy father also called Kennedy O’Brien continued in the leather business diversiving into manufacturing sports shoes and made the running spikes that Ronnie Delaney wore for his 1956 Olympic Medal in Melbourne.\nI found it facinating as a child to visit Portlaw and the other tanneries my grandfather and his children had an involvement in and\nspent many hours in the North Fredrick St. factory in Dublin seeing the cutting and forming of leather into shoes instilling in me a ‘can do’ attitude and encouraging my interest in business, and of course my love of interesting leather shoes.\nThis piece of leather from the Irish Tanneries swatch housed in the Portlaw Heritage Centre and who kindly gave me a piece when I visited last Nov 2016, reminds me that my life is made up of lots of happy childhood family memories around leather.”\n\nSubmitted by: Geraldine O’Brien\n\nKennedy O’Brien\n\n\n\nCAtherine Casey’s funeral\n\nKennedy O’Brien sent a telegram from Dublin\n\nShares\nKennedy O’Brien (founder Irish tanners Portlaw),\nPortlaw Tannery\n\ne largest tannery in Ireland\nconcrete building 1945\n\nhttps://portlawwalkingtrails.wordpress.com/2017/12/16/irish-tanners-portlaw-in-the-20th-century/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\nLimerick Tannery\nhttps://limerickslife.com/ocallaghan/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\nFurther info:\n\nGer Crotty call\nFamily members\n\n\n\nKOB\nArthur Cox\nVincent Crowley\n\nI bought and downloaded this mp3 file for E10\nI met Tom O’Brien at his own home, where we spoke about the day his father started work in a tanning factory in Limerick city, run by the O’Callaghans.

    "text": "The young priest spoke in 1919 to the Gaelic Society of New York about “The Irish Brigade”\n\n\nWe saw in the last post that The Very Reverand Monsignor Richard J Casey amassed a sizeable collection of slides from talks he gave during his time in New York (1915-20) and then afterwards in Ireland during the early years of The Fres State. This time I want to talk about the Revolutionary nature of these talks. Their subject matter, the venues and the newspaper reports, mostly based on newspaper clippings that Casey kept, but also based on more general research into the topic of funding drives in America.\nIt is not clear how many talks Casey gave but we have newspaper clippings of several lectures between 1917 and 1919. I can’t yet work out exactly when the talks became heavily politicised, but in 1916 there were reports of him giving ‘Lenten Sermons’ about the religiosity of Irish faithful back home\nIt is not clear exactly when Casey began giving presentations with slides, but there is one clipping from 1916 which reports him giving ‘Lenten Sermons’ about the religiosity of Irish faithful back home. By 1917, he is talking about life in Beautiful Ireland, as we know from his slides. But his talk has also been politicised a lot, and The Gaelic American reports that ”\n\"[Casey] took occasion at every appropriate time, to demonstrate alleged pernicious results of English misrule in the country.\"\nClearly, the audience were on the same page as the reports that:\nThe photographs of Easter Week, 1916, were wildly applauded. \nOne such name was The Gaelic Society, and by January 1919, Casey was presenting at one of their céilidhthe, a combination that shows how revolutionary fervour could be drummed up amidst a cultural event, and a reminder that the Irish cultural revolution really holds primacy over the political revolution.\n\nCrowdfunding the Republic\n\n\n\nA flyer for Casey’s presentation on Beautiful Ireland - ‘illustrated in picture, song and story’.\n\n\nAmong the revolutionary fervour, there are slides of Wolfe Tone who led the failed rebellion of 1798, Parnell’s body lying in state, and the bronze statue of Fr William Casey in Abbeyfeale, Co. Limerick. This Casey – who is no relation to our subject – must have been quite the role model for our Richard. He was a Gaelgeoir, musician, GAA man, and temperance activist, which I suspect Fr Richard was too. Fr William was most active in the Land League, for which he gained huge local support, and so was Fr Richard’s uncle – another Fr Richard J Casey – to whom I shall one day return. There are no slides related to the Fenian Uprising of 1867, even though its veteran John Devoy had become the leading Republican in New York by the time of Casey’s lectures. This may be because the Fenians tried to keep a low profile and used codenames for their gatherings.\n\n\n\nasdlfkj\n\n\nCasey’s lecture to The Gaelic Society was about ‘The Irish Brigade”, a term used to refer to each sub-unit of the Irish Republican Army, and in May 1919 he was performing at The Central Opera House for between 1200 and 1800 listeners. This venue was used for ’ethnic theatre’ and it occasionally showed films about Ireland.\n\n\n\n\nSt Boniface Holy Name Society\n\n\nIt’s important to note here that these events were not dull lectures, but an ‘illustration’ of Ireland ‘in picture, song and story’. Clearly, Casey was an experienced orator from his sermons, but he was a keen musician and collaborated above with Professor Patrick J McNamara who (need to confirm) ran the St Boniface Holy Name Society. The photo above shows their band – taken from a lantern slide – and, a couple of years after Casey returned home, McNamara wrote to him to lament that there were no more pupils entering the Feis Ceoil. In Casey’s time, his pupils won gold and silver medals. Clearly the band were an ideal segue between the talk and the céilidhe.\nThe music would have had the other function of rousing the audience’s political sentiments and encouraging them to donate. In the same month as Casey’s talk in the Central Opera House, there were reports of $19,000 being raised in New York for the Irish cause. No doubt that increased over time as about a quarter of a million would be raised in America for the First Dail Loan. Casey himself contributed to this which we know because his scrapbook contains receipts of the bonds he himself bought. But his role was not as a financial contributor, but as a trusted man of influence who could rouse others to donate their cash.\nIt was this skill that would prove influential years later when it was time for his younger brother Austie to raise money for the factory in Dungarvan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCol1\n\n\n\n\nCol2\n\n\n\n\nCol3\n\n\n\n\nCol4\n\n\n\n\nCol5\n\n\n\n\nCol6\n\n\n\n\nCol7\n\n\n\n\nCol8\n\n\n\n\nCol9\n\n\n\n\nCol10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 14\n\n\n\n\n1916\n\n\n\n\nYonkers Herald\n\n\n\n\nLenten Sermon\n\n\n\n\nimg_5750\n\n\n\n\nhonest to god sermon about ireland and their good faith etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 27\n\n\n\n\n1917\n\n\n\n\nThe Gaelic American\n\n\n\n\nFr Casey to deliver lecture on Ireland\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCouldnt admit all to Ireland lecture\n\n\n\n\nimg_5757\n\n\n\n\nSt Josephs Hall, Ashburton.

We have a map on the unpartitioned island, some shrivelled up shamrocks, and meticulously preserved castles dating from an ancient time that remains barely fathomable to a New World audience.\n\n\nThe slides that Casey chose portray a land of “emerald hills, the castles of ancient prestige, as well as the modern cities, towns, people and social customs of the old land’, according to one contemporary newspaper report. We have a map of the unpartitioned island, some shrivelled up shamrocks, and meticulously preserved castles dating from an ancient time that must have seemed barely fathomable to his New World audience. There’s The Rock of Cashel, a round tower on Devinish Island in Fermanagh, and the rope bridge near the Giant’s Causeway. Casey includes some images of County Watarford, including the Historic Town of Lismore, Reginald’s Tower in Waterford City, and his own parish church in Dungarvan. There’s an image of a thatched cottage and one (I didn’t see) of Croagh Patrick, a pilgrimage site. There’s a notable lack of barren wild landscapes of the kind Americans like to visit nowadays (e.g. the Ring of Kerry, The Burren, Donegal, etc). There is one of Kilkee in West Clare but I see it either so I don’t know if it’s a photo of the town or the nearby landscapes."

    "text": "Friends of Irish Freedom\n\n\n\nCasey includes an image of the already ancient Theobald Wolfe Tone, but no slides show the Fenian Rebellion of 1867\n\n\nIt is interesting to note Casey’s choice of rebels and reformers. One slide shows Wolfe Tone, who led the failed rebellion of 1798. Another shows the Wicklow Parliamentarian, Charles Stewart Parnell, his deceased body lying in state. Finally, there is bronze statue of Fr William Casey in Abbeyfeale, Co. Limerick, the “peoples’ priest”. This Casey – who is also no relation to our subject – must have functioned as quite the role model for our Richard. He was a Gaelgeoir, a musician, a GAA man, and temperance activist, which I suspect Fr Richard was too. Fr William was most active in the Land League, for which he gained huge local support, and so too was Fr Richard’s uncle – another Fr Richard J Casey – to whom I shall one day return. There are no slides related to the Fenian Uprising of 1867, even though its veteran John Devoy had become the leading Republican in New York by the time of Casey’s lectures. This may be because the Fenians tried to keep a low profile and used codenames for their gatherings. Plus the audience may simply have been familiar with Devoy or the recently-deceased O’Donovan Rossa, and would thus have had no need to slides of them.\nIn my next post, we will see that Casey’s talks may have been part of a series of covert funding campaigns for the Revolution.. For example. one 1919 soirée saw both a céilidhe and Casey’s (music-filled) presentation. It was held by the Gaelic Society in New York. We shall also see newspaper reports of how Casey’s was not afraid to include his thoughts on the English oppressors of the Irish people."

    "section": "Lourdes",
    "text": "Lourdes\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1913, Casey also seems to have been part of very large group of Irish pilgrims to Lourdes: 3000 in total, including 300 priests and another 200 with a religious affiliation, according to the newspaper clippings above, one in French and one in English, and both of which Casey had upscaled into a lantern slide. This pèlerinage seems to have been one of the events of the year for the Lourdais and it would have been quite the journey for the pilgrims on the boat and train. It would no doubt have been quite the badge of honour in New York too. Even today my parents are very proud of their visit to the miraculous site – although they did cycle there (and back) from Paris during their 1990s cycling-getaway heyday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are plenty of photos taken in Lourdes do but I never got to see them. I had it in my head Casey went later but perhaps he went several times, as has since become common. I used to live beside two spinster sisters, just off Meath St, and they had then been volunteering on trips to Lourdes for 25 uninterrupted years, and their living room contained a shrine full of tat. I must drop in some time, armed with a bottle of their beloved vodka, and excavate a few stories from them.\n\nBack in The Free State\n\n\n\nThis slide shows General Richard Mulcahy hoisting the flag of Irish Free State in 1922\n\n\nCasey returned to Ireland in the summer of 1920 and moved to Bray soon after, before finally joining hte Defence Forces as chaplain in 1924. Before seeing the collection, I hadn’t realised that he continued to give projected talks after his return to Ireland but the age of the slides indicate that he must have. There are several slides dating from Casey’s time back in the Auld Sod, and the ones I saw relate to the newly formed Free State in the early 1920s. One shows General Richard Mulcahy hoisting the Irish flag in 1922 and one shows an aerial view of a damaged Four Courts, bombed and burnt during the Civil War. Another shows troops marching to Dolphin’s Barn Barracks from DMP Barracks (which is now the public library in an oddly vacant part of Inchicore). Another aerial shot shows President Cosgrave returning to Monkstown from a League of Nations meeting in 1923, being greeted by crowds who were clearly delighted to see the new state being recognised among the nations of the world. Casey’s scrapbook contains a flyer from April 1922 where he spoke to the Catholic Young Men’s Society on Buckingham St (on the town side of Phibsborough), but the above slides were mostly taken after that.\n\n\n\nCasey spoke to the CYM society in Dublin in 1922, but must have continued beyond this, judging by the date of the slides.\n\n\n\n\nThe Archivists’ Records\n\n\n\nCatalogue details of the Fr Casey collection\n\n\nAbove is the full catalogue record of the collection, with information about what is in the collection, the number of photos, slides and negatives, their condition, and the subject matter. If I can get back in with John Harte, there will be plenty more to sift through.\n\n\nYet more Caseys\nFinally, I should note that, while I was the first member of the public to view the collection, I wasn’t the first to request to view it. It turns out that a genealogist called Paul O’Donnell was in touch with Nora and her colleague Barbara but Covid interrupted his efforts to view it and then, shurlook, you know yourself. So while I was in on site, Barbara found his email, contacted him with my details, and by the end of the day we had a 40 minute phone conversation about the Casey family. It turns out that O’Donnell is married to a Casey from Grawn – the crowd who moved in there after it was sold – and he has done quite a bit of work on the wider family, although his brain is fried by the incessant recurrence of people with the same name (Richard, Pierce, Michael, etc). I will write about that conversation soon, or perhaps after I trek Co Galway to find out more from him."

The best known resident during Casey’s time would have been the fictional James Joyce who, according the O’Brien’s post-modern novel, The Dalkey Archive, was alive and well in the and living out his days in the town as an assistant publican, also known as a curate, a pun which leaves the fictional Joyce doubling up as assistant to the local parish Priest, our very own Very Reverand Monsignor Richard J Casey.↩︎"

We went all the way over there to Abbeyside for some reason and the lot of them showed up in the big car that would put Dickie’s to shame. I don’t know where he was for the day. Very odd altogether. Normally he can get out of anything. So anyway, Lemass is first out of the car, with his big shamrock-green tie on him, and skinnymalinx Dickens is there beside him with those funny gloves in his hands. That Kennedy O’Brien fella – such a name — stumbled out next with his big belly and his watchchain jiggling. I’m surprised some rascal didn’t run and yank it off him at some point. Maybe they were afraid he’d grab them and eat them.\nSo Austie is there saying hello sir and how are you with his big sour face, and it must have been an awful long journey, but these fellas spend half their life in those cars. O’Brien is up and down to Dublin every week and Lemass is all over the country, with all these factories he’s opening the length and breadth of the land.\nSo it’s all handshakes and nods and how’s the missus this and is the young lad still at the hurley. Dickens hasn’t a clue but Austie has his arm around his little shoulders and he gets himself into a nice position at the front of the march as they go over the bridge, with the whole town lined up on the side of the road. The council are there next (DETAILS) and Duffy and Walsh and all their little Garda minions are there with their straight backs.\nSo the band lead the way (SONGS?) and we all file in behind like we’re queueing up for communion, big smiles on everyone’s face, and the kids all messing and running round.

    "title": "Kennedy O’Brien and the Portlaw Tannery",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The Tannery in Portlaw was huge but its output complemented its Dungarvan counterpart.1\nKennedy O’Brien was one of the few bona fide leather men left in early Free State Ireland by which time the tanning industry had dwindled almost entirely out of existence. Yet over the next few decades he helped to build up the industry more than any other person on the ground and his story is an interesting contrast to his colleague-to-be, Austie Casey, because O’Brien was focussed single-mindedly on leather and nothing else, plus he also lived longer to see out his ambitions.\nKennedy O’Brien grew up in Limerick, the son of pig buyer also called Kennedy O’Brien. Kennedy was a given name that went back for generations in that branch of the family and census records of 1911 show eleven men in Ireland of that name, possibly all them related as most of them were in the Limerick area, and only one lived improbably far away. There might have been even more Kennedy O’Briens, only the Catholic Church didn’t like children to be baptised with anything other than a saint’s name, although family lore claims that there was a cheeky way of twisting the church’s arm. Our Kennedy’s father simply told the Parish Priest that if he didn’t let his son be baptised with the preferred name, then the child would be brought round the corner and baptised a Protestant. This did the trick and thus the curious, heavy-duty, forename lived on.\nOur Kennedy O’Brien was aged 22 at the 1911 census, making him a full decade older than Austie. He was listed as an accountant but may have already begun working in O’Callaghan’s Tannery in Limerick City, the last surviving large-scale tannery on the island. He was head-hunted by the Managing Director, Michael O’Callaghan, who would serve as Mayor of Limerick before being murdered in 1921, likely by the Black and Tans or the RIC Auxiliaries.2 But O’Callaghan said he needed someone to help him estimate the number of hides needed in the factory – clearly a job suited to a man of numbers – but O’Brien already had a job lined up in Dublin and was due to begin a few months later. O’Callaghan said that the clever young man was free to leave when his other job was ready to start. O’Brien took the job and clearly found his place in the world as he spent the rest of his life selling and making leather, as well as spawning a handful of sons who followed him into the trade.\nHaving established himself within the Limerick tannery buildings, and built the trust of his boss, O’Brien was given a car and sent out to sell O’Callaghan’s leather to the shoemakers and shoe repair shops of Ireland – all thirty-two counties, as partition was yet to be implemented. This constant movement suited his restless nature and it also gave him a great appreciation of the needs of the Irish people, their need for more employment, and the country’s need for a native tanning industry, rather than importing almost all of its leather from Britain, much of it made from the hides of exported Irish livestock.\nIn 1927, O’Brien set up his own business as a wholesale leather merchant, on 27 North Frederick St in Dublin City, and that building would become the centre of operations for his ever-expanding leather empire. It must have been around this time that he became friendly with Sean Lemass3 who became known for cavorting with city businessmen, playing golf by day or poker at night. Yet cronyism aside, there is unlikely to have been anyone better suited than O’Brien to the task of planning a native tanning industry, between his years of experience, his knowledge of the entire country from his time on the road, and his deep zeal for employment creation. Thus having the Dublin man’s ear would prove most invaluable once the Fianna Fail government took control of the country in 1932 and set out their twin policies of protectionism and decentralization, leading to the establishment of so many factories around the towns of Ireland, big and small. By the mid 1930s, O’Brien’s Dublin business was firmly established, so he would have the time and energy to throw into the Portlaw venture.\nWhy Portlaw?\nThe choice of a settlement as small as Portlaw might seem odd for such a large operation, but DJ Dwyer, in his 1962 study of the Irish Tanning industry, considers it something of a prototypical choice for a tannery. One requirement was easy access to a port (Waterford) as tanning agents had to be imported from around the globe. Secondly, tanneries are better suited to a rural location as the smell and waste are so obnoxious. And finally, there needs to be a lot of water available, coming in and going out of the factory. Water is brought in for the tanning itself and, however unsatisfactory it might be to modern sensibilities, a body of water was needed to dump the untreated waste. The tannery in Gorey had to have a huge waste pipe built, running several miles to the sea. Dickens Leather in Dungarvan, located where the Colligan River meets the sea, could take water from the river and dump it into the sea afterwards. The Portlaw tannery sat on a bend on the River Clodiagh, a tributary of the River Suir, again providing water on both sides. The site had previously been used for a cotton mill in the nineteenth century, run by a Quaker family. Indeed the town was purpose-built for its workers and, when the tannery finally opened, a former employee of the mill, aged 94, showed up and demanded to be given a job in his old haunt.\nIt turns out that Lemass was, in the end, somewhat regretful at having chosen Portlaw as the site of the first Irish tannery, as it was such a small town and Fianna Fail might have gained yet more political traction by putting it into a town with a much larger population – such as Dungarvan – where the staff’s wages could be recirculated more easily, bringing bonhomie to a wider array of voters. Lemass’s choice of Portlaw was informed by government officials who underestimated the coming demand for leather as the state sought self-sufficiency. It quickly became clear that their estimate of 225,000 hides per annum was too low and so was a second estimate of 300,000 hides, made by Vincent Crowley, a Dublin-based solicitor who became Chairman of Irish Tanners and also the accountant for Dickens Leather.\nPersonnel\nWhile the workers in Irish Tanners, Portlaw were local, the management group most certainly weren’t. Kennedy O’Brien became a director and general manager, running the day-to-day operations while his Dublin business ticked over. Crowley was chairman and the secretary was his employee, Dr Jeremiah Dempsey, another city-based professional with his finger in the provincial pie. Despite the name of the tannery, it was actually British-owned and Mary Daly notes this it was registered to the tariff-jumping “British entrepreneur who already owned Western Tanning of Bristol and Redvales Ltd. of Bury.” Presumably, this was HG Barlow, the Managing Director of Irish Tanners, Portlaw’s equivalent of Reginald Dickens who himself was also present at the opening ceremony, along with Dr Austie Casey and many other prominent men of County Waterford.\nIn retrospect, it makes sense to view Portlaw and Dungarvan as complementary businesses, run by an overlapping group of people, especially in the beginning. They were not in direct competition because Portlaw focussed on hard leather soles for shoes, taken from tougher cowhides, whereas Dungarvan would focus on soft leathers taken from sheepskins. We might also think of the Portlaw and Dungarvan tanneries as a three-way compromise between three societal forces. The provincial townspeople did the actual work, capital and industry expertise came from British entrepreneurs (but not the British state), while those based in Dublin functioned as intermediaries between the two.\nHowever, a new law introduced by Fianna Fail required that the new industries not have majority control from a foreign company. Irish Tanners was in part funded by the Irish Credit Company, represented at the opening ceremony by its chairman, J.P. Colbert.4 The ICC was formed in 1933 in an effort to fund the new industries popping up around the country, and it is not much of a jump to imagine that the Dungarvan Tannery, with its complementary output, may have been envisioned as being a second branch of Irish Tanners. However, the ICC did not fund Dungarvan – perhaps it ran out of cash – so Irish capital had to be found from somewhere. We shall see in the next chapter that Reginald Dickens owned exactly half of the shares in Dickens Leather, and no capital came from the state. Thus the Irish interest had to be filled by someone, and Austie Casey and Joe Moloney stepped up to the plate.\nManaging Portlaw remained O’Brien’s primary focus, and by 1957 it was said to be the sixth largest tannery in the world, and managed by his son Bartholemew. His sons became ever more involved in the family business, and Kennedy’s urge to create employment and wealth for his family, saw him set up something of a corridor of his own tanneries stretching between Dublin and Waterford. The first of these was in Gorey (1936) and later in Milford, Co Carlow, Rathangan, Co Kildare and Carnew, Co Wicklow. Meanwhile, his operations in Dublin continued to grow. He had a team of ladies on one floor cutting upper leathers for the shoe repairmen of Dublin and another team producing metal parts for working boots, parts which previously had to be imported from England.\nOne final story should illustrate the continued importance of Kennedy O’Brien to the Irish leather industry, and its ultimate demise in the latter part of the twentieth century. Among his many ventures, O’Brien, along with his namesake son, began producing football boots and running shoes, under the brand name Kayobee, taken from their initials. Kayobee shoes were worn in 1956 by Ronny Delany when he won an Olympic Gold medal in the 1500m, Ireland’s first gold medal since 1932, and the first to be televised. The 1950s would turn out to be the high point of the Irish leather industry, before plastics began to be used, and protectionist policies were relaxed, by Lemass himself. Meanwhile, Kayobee shoes, like all regional brands, would be ousted by some of the most iconic brands in the world, and the Irish tanneries slowly faded into oblivion. The Portlaw tannery finally closed in 1985, having let go of its staff over several phases, while Kennedy O’Brien Leather Merchants closed their door in 1972, with the auctioning off of whatever was left in North Frederick St."

His father seems to have been sympathetic and his brother is known to have been actively involved as a gun runner during the revolutionary years. Their father, Kennedy Sr, bought and sold pigs in Limerick, and it became Bart’s job to walk around with a cart and amass pig swill from the local hotels. This noxious task proved to be the ideal cover for transporting guns because they could be wrapped and placed beneath the swill. And if he was stopped by the police of the auxiliaries, none of them would swirl their hand through the filthy pit of used food. And while this method of transportation befuddled the authorities for a time, word must have leaked out because Bart was tipped off that they were on his case, so he fled to New York where he got a job with the Pinkerton Detective agency and, thanks to his free transport pass, he resumed his gun-running acitivities, only at the other end of the chain.↩︎\nColbert, John Patrick | Dictionary of Irish Biography↩︎"

    "text": "Splendid new leather factory\n\nMonday, May 3, 1937\n\nIrish Press reports the next day\nDungarvan Observer on the Saturday\nIn production for some 12 months\nMachinery worth £13000\n\n\nOpening:\n\nIreland in 1937 was a land filled with the hope of coming prosperity.\n\nWhile it was most certainly a repressive theocracy, it was also a state that had begun building towards self-sufficiency through the sudden emergence of an industrial sector thanks in part to the large tariffs that had recently been placed on imported goods.\n\n\n\nThe opening of Dickens Leather Factory, on Monday, 3 September, 1937 was a special day in the town’s history and it gives us the ideal opportunity to get introduced to the characters in the story and to understand who was who when the factory opened. Officially opened, that is, because the factory was already up and running for fully twelve months (GET DATES) and, given the circumstances, that was the hard part done, as we shall see.\nThe ceremony began with the arrival of Minister Sean Lemass, who was yet again made Minister of Industry and Commerce in the new Dáil of July 1937, where Fianna Fail rubberstamped their authority on the The Irish Free State, winning exactly 50% of seats, before reconstituting the state by the end of the year. Lemass had been most successful in his first ministerial term, opening up countless new factories around the state, including County Waterford’s other leather factory in the village of Portlaw.\nLemass alighted in Abbeyside, the village across the bridge from Dungarvan Town, and he we was met by a local priest and most of the directors of Dickens Leather. Fr T.B. Walsh was the Chairman of the Dungarvan Industrial Development Association, a group that included two local, Dr Michael Augustine Casey and Patrick J. Molony, the managing director of A. Molony and Sons (shipping?)This team had agitated hard to get the factory into Dungarvan and the factory in Portlaw proved to be a complementary stepping stone, in terms of both personnel and output. Portlaw’s produce was mostly based on hard cowhide leather, used in the soles of the shoes, whereas Dungarvan’s produce was mostly based on softer sheepskin leather, used for upper parts of the shoe and inner linings. Their leadership groups were also hugely overlapping. The Chairman of Dickens Leather was Mr Kennedy O’Brien who was becoming something leather baron across Ireland. He was CHAIR? of Portlaw, and his core business was as leather merchant in Dublin City. And the Managing Director was the eponymous Reginald Dickens from England, and his family’s core business was in Northampton, the most famous city in the world for leather and shoe production. Dungarvan and Portlaw, for him, were side ventures from his main business, run by Reginald and his brothers, and by their father before them since 1897.\nThe town was ready for its big day and once the men of influence had assembled, the triumphal procession could begin to slither through the freshly decorated streets, to the roars of the crowd, as cheer after cheer rent the air. Varicoloured bunting festooned the main streets and large banners welcomed the Minister to the town. The local Gardaí formed a bodyguard for Lemass and the parade was fronted by the Waterford Brass and Reed band playing familiar airs, many with a nationalistic bent, for the day was an expression of both national and local pride. The crowd filed in behind them like mass-goers forming a queue for communion and, on arrival at Quay Street, they were met by the hundred-plus men who worked in the factory nearby, at The Lookout, looking out at the wide expanse of Dungarvan Bay.\nA temporary stand was erected and Lemass was greeted by Kennedy O’Brien in his capacity of Chairman of Dickens Leather. Meanwhile, the band played the National Anthem while the deep crowds looked on. Several welcoming addresses were made. First up were The Urban District Council and then Father Walsh himself. Not one, but two local Fianna Fail groups gave an address: the Padraig Pearse Cumann and the Cathal Brugha Cumannn and, finally, an unidentified of the factory’s workforce said some words, with no name given by any of the newspaper reports.\nThe last public address was made by Lemass himself. He thanked and congratulated the above-mentioned men of power, the workers and his Fianna Fail colleagues in the Cumainn, but also spoke the crowd themselves, noting the importance of the factory in generating employment and prosperity to the locality.\nAfterwards, O’Brien presented Lemass with a symbolic gold key to the factory, and, with the church and local government and the politicians having all had their say, and with the band playing Faith of Fathers, it was time for the factory to be blessed solemnly by His Lordship, The Most Reverand Doctor Jeremiah Kinane, Bishop of Waterford and Lismore, ably assisted by the Parish Priest, The Very Reverand T. Canon O’Brien, and his curate, the above-mentioned Reverand TB Walsh.\nAfterwards, Dickens gave the Bishop and Minister a guided tour of inspection of the factory\n\nThe factory was left open for the local hoards to investigate and one wonders how well supervised the machines were with children running round.\nLater in the day, Lemass would point out how great it was that the factory was a truly local venture – and it certainly was for the staff employed in the factory. But the reality is that the directors were a mix of locals (Austie Casey and Joe Molony) with bigger fish.\nIn July 1937, Fianna Fail had yet again won the general election, and were continuing their policy of applying huge tariffs on imported goods, a policy which facilitated the growth of an unprecendented number of mid-sized factories around the state. Sean Lemass was again the Minister of Industry and Commerce, a position he would hold between 1932 and 1959 for for sixteen intermittent years.\n\nThe town\n\nwas en fete for the occasion\nflags and bunting on all the prinicipal streets\n\ncolourful and festive appearance\nfestooned with bunting and schools beating inscriptions of ‘Welcome to the factory’\n\nMusic\n\nwaterford brass and reed band\n\nplayhing national and popular airs\n\n\n\nArrival Order\n\nLemass met at Abbeyside Bridge by\n\nmet by Rev T Walsh, CC, Chairman of Dungarvan Industrial Development Association, and:\n\nthe directors\nmembers of the urban council\nlarge gathering of the general public\n\n\nA bodyguard of honour of the civic guards\n\nChief Superintendant E.

The minister has come here to officially open our factory, and his Lordship the Bishop of Waterford has come to impart God’s blessing upon our industry. On your behalf and on that of the people of Dungarvan, I wish to thank those distinguished gentlemen”\n“Hear, hear”\n“The establishment in Dungarvan of the important factory is due mainly to the efforts made by the members of the Dungarvan Industrial Devopment Association, working unselfishly in the interests of their native town and of the townspeople. In referreint to the DIDC, I wish to make special reference to the work of the Chairman, Rev Father (T B) Walsh and to the members of the committee, including Dr Michael Casey and PJ Molony. These gentlemen and other members of the committee, to my knowlege, spent many weary months in an effort to secure for the town a suitable industry that would provide much neeede employment. I think everyboyd will agree that their efforts have been successful.\n[Speaking from a life of experience, he wrote] The industry is a highly technical one, there is a very large market available within the Irish Free State for its products, [The first and most difficult period of the company’s history has now passed] and employment is given to over 100 male workers to whom good wages are paid.\nThe sales of the company in recent months were higher than even the most optimistic of them had expected when it started and they were still increasing.\nThe establishment of the indusry had been brought about as a result of the industrial policy of the government which aimed at making the country self-sufficient, and, ny creating industries for the manufacture of the country’s requirements, giving much-needed employment.\n\n[include the wage bill here – maybe £300 per week, to be converted to modern money for comparison, but ideally with a list of what that could buy\n\nI should like to express appreciation to those who invested the necessary capital to permit this industry to be started, said Mr O’Brien. I can assue them that it is now firmly establised, that the company’s prospects are, in my opinion, most favourable, and that their interestes will be looked after, to the best of our ability, by me and my co-directors.\nA tribute must be paid to the employees. The managing director has told me that they have adapted themselves very quickly to the training facilities offered to them, and have worked willingly and loyally in the interests of the company.\nThe establishment of this industry has been brought about as a result of the industrial policy of the Government, which has as its object the making of this country self-sufficient, and by the creation of industries for the manufacture of the rquirements of the country, giving much-needed employment. From what I have already told you, I think you will agree that this object has been achieved so far as the factory in Dungarvan is concerned.\n\nIP: @while there might be a feeling of disappointment that a large part of the industrial field was still untilled, very few people were disposed to think that the industrial enterprises set going since the present government took office would ever fall is adequately supported byt heir own opein. And that support, in my opinion, is likely to be forthcoming in ever-increasing measure in the future”\n\nAs an example of what has been achieved in the leather industry, said Mr O’Brien, I am asking th Minister to accept a pair of slippers. The upper leather of these slippers has been manufactured from native Irish sheepskin tanned in our factory here in Dungaravan; the sole and insold leather from native cow-hide tanned in the neighbouring factory in Portlaw; the lasts on which they have been manufactured were made in the recently established factory in Newbridge [lasts are a wooden form on which the leather upper of a shoe is shaped.], and the manufacture of the slippers themselvers was carried out by the well-known and old-establihsed firm of boot and show manufacturers of Messrs Hearne and Cahill, Waterford. The slippers are presented not for their intrinsic valude as a memento of the work done in the establishment and development of Irish industries by the Minister for Industry and commerce.\nApplause\n\nFind out the yeas in which each of these factories was established\n\nJust another day at the office for Lemass\nThis is where the cartoon ought to go\nReplying to the toast, Mr Lemass said thay they had gathered from the newspaper reports that he frequeently had occasion to attend functions like that, and for one holding the position fo Minister for Industry and Commerce it was always a pleasure to be present at such function, but the pleasure was not entirely an unmixed one, because as time passed it became increasingly difficult to say something original. This was the first occasion he was able to visit Dungarvan for a number of years, and he was very glad that the occasion was one associated with the establishment of an industry in the town, [with characteristic vision, he continued] an industry that would not merely be of considerable benefit to the town at present, but offers considerable prospects of development for the future, enabling it to extend its roll of its employees, enlarge the sum which is distributed in weekly wages, and thus extending the trade of the town, and help to add to its presperity, and promote the general business activities of the town.\nIf there is one reason more than another why I am please to be associated with this enterprise, he said, is because in the best and truest sense of the term this is a local enterprise.\n\nOf course there was a swathe of outsiders with their fingers in this local pie (Dickens, O’Brien, Crowley)\n\n\nMr Lemass continued that the history of the establishment of this factory in Dungarvan would be a source of benefit to the citizens of other towns in the Free State, in which factories of a similar nature had not yet been set up, and where the volume of demand for such a factory had grown in persistence. [e.g. Carrick-on-Suir for leather, but plenty more other factories]. He was glad that a tribute had been paid to the local committee because the factory would not have been established at all only for their efforts.\n\nwhose efforts led to the formation of a company financed without outsdie assistance or the usual underwriting facilities.\n\n\nAt some stage a factory such as this would have been set up in the country, but not necessarily by the compnay which was no operating here, and certainly not in Dungarvan, were it not for the work of the local committee, of which he had personal evidence a long time ago. [Walsh, Casey, Molony et al] They set out to establish an industry here and very quickly established contact with teh Department and he was glad that they were able to assiste them. Again, the company was formed and finance without outside assistance, underwriting facilities or any other financial help, as was due not alone to the promoters but to the good citizenship of the people of Dungaravvan and the locality,\n\nit was an investment that showed not only their belief in the industrial future of this countr, but also their confidence in the ability of their own townmen to make good in industrial work.\n\nand he did not think that at any time they would have reaon to regret what they had done and the investment they had made. This industry, like all new industries, had to overcome difficulties, had (?)not been surmounted and the company was progressing very satisfactorily indeed.\nDamn the begrudgers\nSpeaking on the industrial development of the country, the Minister said that what had been said, written and through about the industrial future of this country in past years, was nonsense and was used by those who had vested interests in maintaining the old position. When the opportunity was given for developing the industrial position of the country that opportunity was availed of not by the people of one party or one class, but was availed of by a large numer of people in the country, many of whom differed fundamentally in matters of political policy in other directions.\n“In these days of economic stress”, said Mr Lemass, “We are all naturally perturbed at the continued existence of unemployment on a wide scale, and emigration, which stopped for a short time, and is now resumed”\n\nNeed to check stats on that. The issue being that there were no jobs abroad now to emigrate to\nNo one emigrated to America\n\nHe was sure that most thinking people realised that the problem of unemployment and the problem of emigration were both the same, and the social evils to which they gave rise could not be terminated without the greatest degree of industrial development that circumstances would permit.\n“Irrespective of the opintions we might hold on a wide variety of things,” said Mr Lemass, “there is no substantion section of our people who do not know the urgency of industrial development so that people might be given more employment and a wider variety of employment”\nThe minister continued by saying that if they could secure the maximum of industrial development, and secure at the same time that needs of the people in housing were adequately catered for, they could usefully occupy the labour of every unemployed man amongst them.\nConcluding, the Minister said that they had a number of economoic problems for soluation and a very large number of of social evils to terminate. He trusted that the succes which had met the efforts of the local committed in Dungaravan, which resulted in giving employment to more than one hundred men in the town who would otherwise be idle or forced to emigrate, would encourage other committees in the country to make a special effort to solve their own problems, and he could assure them that if they had any practical plans they could rely on the cooperation of not merely the Dept of INdustry and Commerce, but of every Government department\nApplause\nOther Toasts\nProposing the toast of ‘The Company’, Rev Fr Walsh, BA, CC, Dungarvan said that the products of the factory had entered most of the homes of this country. [(t was a matter of nationwide significance. The minister had spoken very highly of them, and it was very kind of him. The local Industrical Development Committe had done as far as it could its best. That day they had seen a body of men at the factory engaged in manufacture, with the knowledge that they were not distributing foreing goods, but engaged in the noble work of making goods for consumption by the Irish people. The best bulwark the clergy have against Communism, or any other ism”, said Father Walsh, “the best guarantee of fidelity [Faith and Fatherland] we have is the contented working man.”\n\nHe concluded by saying that they were deeply indebted to Mr Dickens, who had come there to teach them about the business to which he had given a lifetime.\n\nSupporting the toast, Mr EA Ryan, State Solicitor, said they had taken part in what he considered to be a very momentous event that day. They were there representing as they did a part of a living generation of Irishmen and women and have taken ……. what has been one of the most extraordinary political and economic revoluations in the history of the world, and developing towards what he hoped would be the complete and absolute political and economic freedom of this country. That might sound extraordinary to some people, but it was a natural expression of thought on his part. Referring to the fishing industry, he said that the town was once a great fishing town, and he could remember in his boyhood days seeing fifty or sixty crafts at the quays, and he hoped that in the near future something would again be done for that industry. [ there are numerous young men who could fin employment int he fishing industry and he hoped that somethign would be done for them]\nMR R Dickens, replying to the toast, said that he had taken on a job of work, and he intended to see it through. He paid tribute to the wonderful cooperation he had received from the people of Dungarvan. [he was grateful for the consideration which he had receieved from the MinistRY of Industry and Commerce]\nThe toast of “Our Guests” was proposed by Dr M Casey, who, in doing so, said that he wnated to see more people employed in the town, and he wanted to see Dungarvan and the whole of the county prosperous. [the opening of the factory was a work for the betterment ofthe people of the country and was a memorable event int he history of the borough of Dungarvan].\nVery Reverand Canon O’Brien, supporting the toast, said that the prosperity of the town was undoubtedly growing. [the happiest relations existed between the men employed and the management of the factory] (a situation that wsa not to last)\nMrs Redmond, TD, replying to the toast, said that Dungarvan and Waterford as a whole had suffered much in recent years, and, therefore, it was very good to see this industry established. Money and expense had not been thought about in establishing the industry, and she could see no reason why the factory should not have a prosperous future. [she hoped that the new industry would eb the forerunner of others to come in Dungarvan] how many women TDs were there\nMr PJ LIttle, TD, also replied to the toast, the proceedings closed with the singing of the National Anthem by all present.\n\n\n\n\nAmongst those present at the opening ceremony and luncheon were:\nSpeakers in Bold:\nItalics means mentioned by the Irish press\nHow many women?\nMessrs.

We have a map on the unpartitioned island, some shrivelled up shamrocks, and meticulously preserved castles dating from an ancient time that remains barely fathomable to a New World audience.\n\n\nThe slides that Casey chose portray a land of “emerald hills, the castles of ancient prestige, as well as the modern cities, towns, people and social customs of the old land’, according to one contemporary newspaper report. We have a map of the unpartitioned island, some shrivelled up shamrocks, and meticulously preserved castles dating from an ancient time that must have seemed barely fathomable to his New World audience. There’s The Rock of Cashel, a round tower on Devinish Island in Fermanagh, and the rope bridge near the Giant’s Causeway. Casey includes some images of County Watarford, including the Historic Town of Lismore, Reginald’s Tower in Waterford City, and his own parish church in Dungarvan. There’s an image of a thatched cottage and one (I didn’t see) of Croagh Patrick, a pilgrimage site. There’s a notable lack of barren wild landscapes of the kind Americans like to visit nowadays (e.g. the Ring of Kerry, The Burren, Donegal, etc). There is one of Kilkee in West Clare but I see it either so I don’t know if it’s a photo of the town or the nearby landscapes."

    "text": "Friends of Irish Freedom\n\n\n\nCasey includes an image of the already ancient Theobald Wolfe Tone, but no slides show the Fenian Rebellion of 1867\n\n\nIt is interesting to note Casey’s choice of rebels and reformers. One slide shows Wolfe Tone, who led the failed rebellion of 1798. Another shows the Wicklow Parliamentarian, Charles Stewart Parnell, his deceased body lying in state. Finally, there is bronze statue of Fr William Casey in Abbeyfeale, Co. Limerick, the “peoples’ priest”. This Casey – who is also no relation to our subject – must have functioned as quite the role model for our Richard. He was a Gaelgeoir, a musician, a GAA man, and temperance activist, which I suspect Fr Richard was too. Fr William was most active in the Land League, for which he gained huge local support, and so too was Fr Richard’s uncle – another Fr Richard J Casey – to whom I shall one day return. There are no slides related to the Fenian Uprising of 1867, even though its veteran John Devoy had become the leading Republican in New York by the time of Casey’s lectures. This may be because the Fenians tried to keep a low profile and used codenames for their gatherings. Plus the audience may simply have been familiar with Devoy or the recently-deceased O’Donovan Rossa, and would thus have had no need to slides of them.\nIn my next post, we will see that Casey’s talks may have been part of a series of covert funding campaigns for the Revolution.. For example. one 1919 soirée saw both a céilidhe and Casey’s (music-filled) presentation. It was held by the Gaelic Society in New York. We shall also see newspaper reports of how Casey’s was not afraid to include his thoughts on the English oppressors of the Irish people."

    "text": "Lourdes\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1913, Casey also seems to have been part of very large group of Irish pilgrims to Lourdes: 3000 in total, including 300 priests and another 200 with a religious affiliation, according to the newspaper clippings above, one in French and one in English, and both of which Casey had upscaled into a lantern slide. This pèlerinage seems to have been one of the events of the year for the Lourdais and it would have been quite the journey for the pilgrims on the boat and train. It would no doubt have been quite the badge of honour in New York too. Even today my parents are very proud of their visit to the miraculous site – although they did cycle there (and back) from Paris during their 1990s cycling-getaway heyday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are plenty of photos taken in Lourdes do but I never got to see them. I had it in my head Casey went later but perhaps he went several times, as has since become common. I used to live beside two spinster sisters, just off Meath St, and they had then been volunteering on trips to Lourdes for 25 uninterrupted years, and their living room contained a shrine full of tat. I must drop in some time, armed with a bottle of their beloved vodka, and excavate a few stories from them.\n\nBack in The Free State\n\n\n\nThis slide shows General Richard Mulcahy hoisting the flag of Irish Free State in 1922\n\n\nCasey returned to Ireland in the summer of 1920 and moved to Bray soon after, before finally joining hte Defence Forces as chaplain in 1924. Before seeing the collection, I hadn’t realised that he continued to give projected talks after his return to Ireland but the age of the slides indicate that he must have. There are several slides dating from Casey’s time back in the Auld Sod, and the ones I saw relate to the newly formed Free State in the early 1920s. One shows General Richard Mulcahy hoisting the Irish flag in 1922 and one shows an aerial view of a damaged Four Courts, bombed and burnt during the Civil War. Another shows troops marching to Dolphin’s Barn Barracks from DMP Barracks (which is now the public library in an oddly vacant part of Inchicore). Another aerial shot shows President Cosgrave returning to Monkstown from a League of Nations meeting in 1923, being greeted by crowds who were clearly delighted to see the new state being recognised among the nations of the world. Casey’s scrapbook contains a flyer from April 1922 where he spoke to the Catholic Young Men’s Society on Buckingham St (on the town side of Phibsborough), but the above slides were mostly taken after that.\n\n\n\nCasey spoke to the CYM society in Dublin in 1922, but must have continued beyond this, judging by the date of the slides.\n\n\n\n\nThe Archivists’ Records\n\n\n\nCatalogue details of the Fr Casey collection\n\n\nAbove is the full catalogue record of the collection, with information about what is in the collection, the number of photos, slides and negatives, their condition, and the subject matter. If I can get back in with John Harte, there will be plenty more to sift through.\n\n\nYet more Caseys\nFinally, I should note that, while I was the first member of the public to view the collection, I wasn’t the first to request to view it. It turns out that a genealogist called Paul O’Donnell was in touch with Nora and her colleague Barbara but Covid interrupted his efforts to view it and then, shurlook, you know yourself. So while I was in on site, Barbara found his email, contacted him with my details, and by the end of the day we had a 40 minute phone conversation about the Casey family. It turns out that O’Donnell is married to a Casey from Grawn – the crowd who moved in there after it was sold – and he has done quite a bit of work on the wider family, although his brain is fried by the incessant recurrence of people with the same name (Richard, Pierce, Michael, etc). I will write about that conversation soon, or perhaps after I trek Co Galway to find out more from him."
